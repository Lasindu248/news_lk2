    "The Committee also sought details on each of these companies and the quantity of ethanol imported by those companies.",
    "The Committee which met yesterday also inquired into the issuance of licenses for the importation of vehicles and spare parts to Sri Lanka.",
    "Although it had previously been instructed to take the necessary steps to formulate a proper procedure in coordination with the Department of Motor Traffic, the Committee expressed its displeasure that no action had been taken in this regard.",
    "The Committee requested that a suitable methodology be prepared to maintain the relevant activities in a more efficient and transparent manner and submit it within four months.",

    "The Committee pointed out that the lack of proper coordination with the Direct Liaison Institutions such as the Excise Department, the Department of Motor Traffic and the Sri Lanka Customs is very problematic in conducting the activities of the Department and was instructed to take the necessary steps to do computer networking immediately.",
    "To this end, the importance of liaising with institutions such as the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, the Committee emphasised.",
    "Although the officials of the Department of Import and Export Control were informed about this matter in the year 2016, the Committee expressed its displeasure that this work has not been done so far and considering the importance of this, the Chairman of the Committee decided to appoint a Sub-Committee to inquire into its progress. Also, attention was drawn to the subsequent transfer of vehicles imported under the prize scheme to various parties.",
    "Accordingly, after the vehicles were imported under the gift scheme, the officers present were asked about the transfer of the vehicles to other parties.",

They stated that even after five years of such transfers, the necessary procedures have been put in place to recover the normal tax value of the relevant vehicles.",
