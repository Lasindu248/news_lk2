    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) said it is extremely concerned about the current serious situation in Sri Lanka. In such a context SLMA, as the members of the apex body of healthcare professionals made the following suggestions and recommendations:",
    "\u2022 We roundly condemn the use of tear gas and the use of violence by the law enforcement authorities against peaceful protestors and fellow citizens. The chemicals contained in tear gas are well known to cause respiratory difficulties, irritation of eyes and skin, and carry significant health risks.",
    "\u2022 The SLMA is extremely concerned about the Declaration of Emergency by the government. Such a measure has the potential to trigger man forms of violence, which could lead to the deterioration of an already volatile situation and harming the wellbeing of innocent citizens, causing injuries to the protesters as well as the security personnel. As such an eventuality could cause irreparable damage, we are compelled to urge the government to withdraw the State of Emergency forthwith.",
    "\u2022 The SLMA call upon the government to resolve their political differences immediately and bring back normalcy to our country.",
    "\u2022 The SLMA earnestly request the powers-that-be to listen to the public outcry and work towards an expedited solution towards the welfare of our beloved Motherland.",
