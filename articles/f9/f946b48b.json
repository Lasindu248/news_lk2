    "CSE trading was positive throughout yesterday mainly due to market speculation that business magnate Dhammika Perera would be entering Parliament following former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation from the national list position in the legislature . Due to this development, companies that Perera has invested in and is heading showed remarkable price appreciation yesterday.",
    "The index- weighted blue chip companies that Perera has invested in, especially Vallibel One, Hayleys, Singer (Sri Lanka), Royal Ceramic and Sampath Bank share prices appreciated during the day.
