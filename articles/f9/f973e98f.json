    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board M.M.C. Ferdinando has said that Sri Lanka is forced to suspend the supply of electricity as the CEB cannot meet the demand.",
    "\u201cWe cannot generate over 300 MW of power from hydropower plants, and we need 800 MW of power from 6:30 PM to 10 PM daily from hydropower plants, and we cannot generate that requirement. We require 1,100 MW from Thermal Power Plants, and that too is difficult for us due to the shortage of fuel,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday (31).",
    "\u201cHowever, as the coal power plants are operating continuously, we are depending on them today,\u201d he noted adding that if the CEB receives fuel continuously it can opt out of power outages.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Power Pavithra Vanniarachchi said that the then-government constructed the necessary power plants to meet Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity requirement until 2014 were constructed.",
    "She said the necessary measures were taken to even construct a power plant in Sampura, but that did not become a reality, since the then government was defeated.",
    "\u201cSince then not a single power plant was constructed despite there was a need to do so. That is why we had to resort to power cuts in 2019,\u201d she told reporters.",
    "She also noted that before opting for power cuts, certain institutions were not included in the power outage schedule, adding that 165 feeders of the CEB are not linked to the outages.",
    "\u201cHouses and other establishments that are connected to those feeders will continue to receive electricity. However, I instructed officials to ensure that only the target institutions are spared and the other areas too experience the outages,\u201d she told reporters.",
    "State Minister Duminda Dissanayake also speaking at the media briefing with the Minister of Power said if Sri Lanka cannot source US dollars, no matter who comes into power, there is no way to move forward.",
    "\u201cWe need to establish renewable energy in Sri Lanka for local production. We believe by 2022 December we can add over 2,000 MW to the national grid. Then there will be no issue,\u201d he added."
