  "body_lines": [
    "Deputy Speaker of Parliament Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says he steps down from his position effective today (April 30).",
    "Addressing a media briefing in Colombo today, he said a new Deputy Speaker will be appointed at the next parliamentary session next week.",
    "Siyambalapitiya stated that he handed over a letter to the President and the Speaker of Parliament yesterday, informing that he would not serve as the Deputy Speaker hereafter.",
    "Earlier this month, Sri Lanka Freedom Party\u2019s parliamentary group decided that its 14 lawmakers including former President Maithripala Sirisena would represent the Parliament independently.",
    "Consequently, Siyambalapitiya informed the President of his intention to resign as the Deputy Speaker.",
    "However, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa refused to accept Siyambalapitiya\u2019s letter of resignation, stating that parliamentary democracy needs to be maintained.",
    "As the post of the Deputy Speaker of Parliament is an independent appointment and taking into account the need to continue the parliamentary proceedings amidst the present situation, President Rajapaksa had told Siyambalapitiya that his resignation would be dismissed.",
    "Delivering a special statement in the House last Friday (April 08), Siyambalapitiya, however, said he would remain in his position only until the end of April."
