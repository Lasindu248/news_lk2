  "body_lines": [
    "Religious leaders today opposed the decision made by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the new Prime Minister.",
    "Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said Mr. Wickremesinghe does not command a majority in Parliament. \u201c Mr. Wickremesinghe is the only MP who represents his party. Therefore the appointment is not legal,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cPresident should listen to the request made by the Mahanayaka Theras who wanted a nonpartisan person to be appointed as the Premier,\u201d he added.",
    "Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thero said the President has no right to go against the will of the people. \u201c People never expected\u00a0 this kind of Prime Minister. The Former Prime Minister also deceived the people and left creating a mess.\u00a0 President also seems to be following the same path,\u201d he said.",
    "Venerable Thero said the request that has been made by Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa to be appointed as the Premier should be heeded by the President. A non partisan person should come forward through the leader of the opposition. The President should have a dialogue with everyone concerned,\u201d he added.(Yohan Perera)"
