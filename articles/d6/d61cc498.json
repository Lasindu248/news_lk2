  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Attorney-at-law Senaka Perera who heads Sri Lanka\u2019s People\u2019s Lawyers Association (PLA) was summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Monday (06) morning.",
    "Perera has been an active participant at the \u2018aragalaya\u2019 anti-government protests that have been held continuously at Galle Face, Colombo, demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis.",
    "\u201cI will only know [the reason for the summons] when I go inside. It would\u2019ve been better if they had communicated the reasons to me, so I could\u2019ve come prepared,\u201d Perera told reporters outside the CID premises.",
    "\u201cI stood for the people and their problems and for the \u2018aragalaya\u2019. We haven\u2019t done anything [wrong]. It is very unfortunate if that is being used as a reason to victimise us,\u201d he said.",
    "Perera was the latest in a number of activists and media personalities summoned by the CID. Among the others were journalist Dharshana Handungoda.",
    "\u201cWe cannot be silenced with stunts like this. We will be more active tomorrow than we are today,\u201d said Perera.",
    "A protest against the CID summons was held outside its premises Monday morning. (Colombo/May06/2022)"
