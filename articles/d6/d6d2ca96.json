    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s government has decided to seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance in the face of its worsening economic crisis but the country must be mindful of the organisation\u2019s core policies, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivaar Cabraal told an all-party conference on Wednesday (23).",
    "\u201cThe opposition and various experts have expressed the belief that connecting with the IMF will boost investor confidence and encourage non-loan inflows. \u00a0The IMF has also stressed the urgency of implementing a credible and coherent strategy to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.",
    "\u201cWe must also remember that when dealing with the IMF over various economic matters, their policies might be strict,\u201d said Cabraal.",
    "Before President Gotabaya Rajapaksa confirmed Sri Lanka\u2019s plans to go to the IMF, Cabraal had repeatedly denied speculation on the matter and had also reportedly been opposed to the move. There had also been speculation about a rift between Finance Minister Basil Rajapaka and the Central Bank.",
    "Sri Lanka President says has full confidence in CB Governor Cabraal",
    "The central bank chief was speaking at an all-party conference called by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on a proposal by former president Maithripala Sirisena. The conference, currently taking place in Colombo at the time of writing, is being boycotted by the main opposition the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) and the opposition National People\u2019s Power (NPP). However, the opposition United National Party (UNP) and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) are in attendance.",
    "Briefing the gathering on Sri Lanka\u2019s prevailing crisis \u2013 one of the worst in the island nation\u2019s history \u2013 Cabraal many countries suffered the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but some countries were better prepared than others for the economic fallout that came in its wake.",
    "\u201cWhen the pandemic was emerging, some countries were on a strong economic footing. But some countries had weakened for various reasons,\u201d he said.",
    "This comment drew the ire of former Prime Minister and UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who took Cabraal to task for bringing up party politics into an important discussion.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to discuss party politics or who is responsible. We didn\u2019t come here for politics as intimated by the governor. I regret that he started off by saying this was the previous government\u2019s fault,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cWhat happens if I respond to that? Would that also warrant a response? This will go on, and will end up with Prince Vijaya since none of this would\u2019ve happened if he never arrived in Lanka,\u201d he said, inviting laughter from President Rajapaksa.",
    "\u201cI will only say one thing on this. We were on a different policy trajectory. Back then, people had food to eat, had petrol, etc, I won\u2019t say any more than that,\u201d the former premier said as the president continued to chuckle.",
    "Wickremesinghe also noted the absence of the other opposition parties.",
    "\u201cA section of the opposition is not here. I didn\u2019t come here to defeat them. We have to go and tell them what was discussed here and also get them on board,\u201d he said.",
    "The UNP leader then had an exchange of words with finance minister Basil Rajapaksa over the IMF\u2019s report on Sri Lanka.",
    "He reiterated an ongoing demand for the report to be tabled in parliament, to which the finance minister insisted that the report has not yet been made available to the government.",
    "\u201cThis was promised to us on several occasions. I think that\u2019s the reason some parties are not in attendance here. I would like to know if we can have it this week or next,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Rajapaksa said: \u201cThe IMF report hasn\u2019t been made fully available to us yet.\u201d",
    "A back-and-forth ensued, and it was agreed that a draft of the report has indeed been sent to the government. Rajapaksa said some of the contents of the draft have been challenged by the government, and the IMF will finalise the report and send it back.",
    "\u201cSo you admit the draft has come. All this time, it was said it hadn\u2019t arrived,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cWell, a draft \u2013 it first has to be discussed with us. You know better than I do,\u201d said Rajapaksa.",
    "Asked by Rajapaksa if Wickremesnghe wanted the draft which cannot be given as it has yet to be finalised, Wickremesinghe responded seemingly in jest: \u201cNo, don\u2019t give it to me. Or [someone] will say a deal has been made.\u201d (Colombo/Mar23/2022)"
