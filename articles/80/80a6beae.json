    "Interruptions to the electricity supply are most unlikely on the 13th and 14th of April, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says.",
    "According to the chairman of electricity sector regulator Janaka Ratnayake, the Ceylon Electricity Board is in possession of adequate stocks of fuel and furnace oil required for power generation.",

    "The PUCSL meanwhile approved reduced power cuts for this weekend with two-hour power interruptions on Saturday (April 09) and one-hour power cuts on Sunday (April 10).",
