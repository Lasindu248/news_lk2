    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Power cuts up to 3 hours and 20 minutes have been approved for Sri Lanka for April 23, Public Utilities Commission Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said as money printing by the central bank triggered forex shortages, disrupting fuel imports.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s power earlier requested 4 hours and 30 minutes of power cuts for April 24 with 3 hours in the daytime and 1.5 hours in the evening but may reduce the duration by 30 minutes if more fuel or water is available.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing forex shortages due to money printed by the central bank to keep interest rates low which has disrupted fuel imports triggering power cuts.",
    "Between 830 and 600pm 3 hours of power would be cut but the duration may be reduced by 30 minutes either at the beginning or end of the slot.",
    "In the Colombo City centre there will be power cuts between 6.00 am and 09.30 am."
