  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The capacity of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank to repay the International Monetary Fund has to be monitored, the Washington based lender has said as the country\u2019s foreign reserves fell and the agency ended up with net debt.",
    "The central bank owes the IMF about 1.3 billion US dollars from the last Extended Fund Facility or 903 million special drawing rights.",
    "\u201cWhile the credit outstanding and the payments due are not large and Sri Lanka has kept a sound track record of repaying debt, its precarious reserves position, debt overhang, as well as persistent fiscal and BoP financing shortfalls pose high risks to Sri Lanka\u2019s capacity to repay the Fund,\u201d the IMF said in a staff report.",
    "The loan was about 1.5 percent of GDP and was below the level that requires post program monitoring.",
    "The central bank has to pay the IMF 114.5 million US dollars in 2022. From 2022 to 2029 an average of 170 million US dollars a year has to be paid.",
    "The central bank also owes money to domestic swap counterparties, the Reserve Bank of India, the Bangladesh Bank. According the latest available data reserves were negative by 3.2 billion US dollars.",
    "The central bank borrows money as money printed under a \u2018flexible inflation targeting\u2019, involving un-anchored policy leads to currency crises and forex shortages.",
    "During the last program the central bank printed large volumes of money by running circles around a \u2018monetary consultation clause\u2019.",
    "The program did not have a reserve money target or a floor on domestic assets to control economists who wanted to print money under the guise of \u2018monetary policy independence.\u2019",
    "During the program attempts were made to legalize discretionary monetary policy though \u2018flexible inflation targeting\u2019 and also indemnify the leadership though a new law.",
    "Flexible inflation targeting (a discretionary domestic anchor) was complemented by a discretionary soft-peg or an unworkable intermediate regime called the \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019."
