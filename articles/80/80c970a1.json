    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe threatened to resign if the country\u2019s leaders cannot ensure political stability as it is crucial to come out of the ongoing economic crisis.",
    "\u201cI have told all political party leaders that if they can\u2019t ensure political stability, there is no point of remaining as central bank governor,\u201d he told a media briefing in Colombo on Wednesday (11).",
    "\u201cIt is not about me. Even if another person comes to this position, he won\u2019t be able to handle the current crisis.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has already suspended foreign debt repayment since April 12 as it has run out of reserves.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t even have reserves to import essentials for the next one week,\u201d he said.",
    "Weerasinghe was appointed early April after former central bank chief Ajith Nivard Cabraal resigned on April 03 after the cabinet quit in the face of protests across the country.",
    "Since Weerasinghe took over, the central bank has raised policy rates by 7 percent, allowed the risk-free government treasury bill yield to more than double to 23 percent, and attempted to allow gradual flexibility in the exchange rate.",
    "He along with Finance Minister Ali Sabry and Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena took part in the initial discussions with the IMF for a loan programme.",
    "Political stability is a prerequisite for any IMF programme. Government officials say a delay in the IMF programme in the absence of political stability could also delay the recovery from the current economic crisis. (Colombo/May11/2022)"
