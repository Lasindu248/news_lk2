    "The Samagi Jana Balawegauaya (SJB) will support the 21st Amendment only if its shortcomings are rectified, SJB CEO Ajith P. Perera said.",
    "Perera told a press conference that his party had already proposed some amendments to the legislation such as prohibiting the President from holding any ministerial portfolio, giving more say to Parliament on deciding on dissolution. \u201cWe believe that the House should be given the right to dissolve itself through a resolution,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe will support the 21st Amendment only if these shortcomings are rectified. We are also in favour of abolishing the Executive Presidency,\u201d he added.",
    "Meanwhile, SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara proposed more amendments such as bringing in provisions to prevent those who hold dual citizenships to be elected or appointed to Parliament.",
    "In another development UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardene said some political parties are trying to play games with the 21st Amendment just to fulfil their own dreams. \u201cSome dream of becoming the President and others dream of becoming the Prime Minister. Therefore some political parties seem to be playing games with the proposed 21st Amendment,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
