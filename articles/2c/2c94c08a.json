    "The country appears to have reached a position of stability. But this is deceptive. Every day the price of food increases. Less can be bought with the wages earned that day. The anticipated food shortages have manifested themselves though the sufferings and deprivations are private and personal for the most part. They come out into the open when an office worker may tell that they have no money to go back home in the bus at the end of the working day. Or it manifests itself in the statement of the UN representative Hanaa Singer-Hamdy who has said that 22 percent of the Sri Lankan population or 4.9 million people live in need of food assistance at the moment. She said there is a 40 to 50 percent reduction in paddy crop harvest in this period.",
    "The appearance of stability, in the political domain has also increased in the aftermath of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s appointment as Prime Minister. Under him it appears to be business as usual. The government has continued to add to the number of ministers, the latest being Dhammika Perera, who is a businessman of wealth and repute as financial counsellor to the ruling politicians. The expectations of a collapse of the government, which were heightened with the breakdown of law and order and mob attacks a month ago, seem to be no longer a serious threat. But inexorably, the economic situation continues to worsen by the day. The lines in front of the few fuel stations that are open continue to grow longer and longer.",
    "Therefore, the sense of dissatisfaction, within the general population with regard to the lack of economic progress, continues to seethe. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Country Representative for Sri Lanka Vimlendra Sharan has said in a recent interview that the Sri Lankan farmer is one of the best he has seen, highly-educated and very receptive, so he did not think there is any blame lying with the farmers. FAO understands that some fertiliser, through bilateral sources like India, is reaching Sri Lanka, but it is still in the pipeline and yet to come to Sri Lanka, while the season has started. This disaster alone for which the Rajapaksa administration has to take full responsibility justifies the call of the Aragalaya \u2013 Gota Go Home.",
    "The causes that gave rise to the Aragalaya protests continue in full force. The main demand of the Aragalaya protestors has consistently been that the President should step down on account of the serious errors of judgment he has made using those powers. The worst of these was to ban the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, overnight, in pursuit of a utopian vision of organic farming found nowhere else in the world. At the UN General Assembly, he stated that Sri Lanka would be the first country to become fully organic in farming. There is no evidence this folly was highlighted to him or his team in the halls of the UN, which could have prevented this catastrophe.",
    "The Federation of University Teachers (FUTA) has issued a statement demanding that \u201cThe government must acknowledge its loss of legitimacy. A credible interim government should be established. The President should immediately resign. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, working on the basis of support from the SLPP, is not a viable option.\u201d",
    "Seeing the attitude of business as usual in their colleagues, some more percipient political party leaders in the government coalition have warned that unless the situation improves fast there could be a worse outbreak of violence than what took place a month ago, in the days that followed the fateful attack by government goons on peaceful protestors at the Aragalaya site. Former minister Wimal Weerawansa has said, \u201cLast time the attackers set only the politicians\u2019 houses on fire. Next time they would target affluent and rich families, too. They will attack everyone using luxury vehicles and those living in luxury homes. That is the inevitable future if the government keeps playing games with the crises.\u201d",
    "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has successfully eroded the support base of the protestors by negating the need for them. The anticipated crackdown on protestors has not materialised with his ascension to the premiership, and there continues to be freedom to criticise the government leaders, including himself in public. But the practices of the past that have spelled ruination, such as the appointment of political favourites and rigging of contracts continue. In these circumstances, the civil society focus at present has shifted to the promotion of political reform through the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. But notably, it does not significantly reduce the president\u2019s powers in the manner that was originally anticipated. This makes the entire debate and hullabaloo about the 21st Amendment a moot point.",
    "The FUTA statement further observes that \u201cThe current economic crisis is the combined outcome of the failure of long-term economic policies and economic mismanagement of successive governments. The current regime\u2019s alleged corruption, their preoccupations with familial and dynastic rule, and their disregard for democratic and participatory governance coupled with their colossal failures in policy and implementation are also to be blamed. Any attempt to pull ourselves out of the crisis, therefore, requires that we treat the spheres of politics and economics as connected. Politically, we should hasten to transform a system where the centralization of power enabled corruption at all levels of governance.\u201d",
    "Civil society needs to focus on economic issues also. The government is seeking to get an IMF loan that would give it breathing space to get the economy back on track. The IMF in turn expects the government to come up with a plan in which its revenues correspond to expenditures. This would require downscaling of government expenditures. At present the government appears to be targeting social welfare for reduction. The health sector is the clearest example. Doctors in the state sector are appealing for medical supplies. The supplies are available with the private sector but at an unaffordable price to most people. These medical supplies are unavailable to them, as the government has not provisioned for them. Its priorities lie elsewhere such as building new houses for parliamentarians.",
    "The reduction of the powers of the presidency were expected to be a basic feature of the 21st Amendment. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has stated that he intends to stay for the full duration of his term. He also said that his \u201cpersonal opinion is that if you have a Presidency he must have full powers. Otherwise abolish the executive presidency and go for full Westminster-style parliament.\u201d The ruling party continues to enjoy a comfortable majority in Parliament which was demonstrated in the course of the controversial vote on the Ceylon Electricity Board Bill, where parliament decided to do away with the need for competitive bidding when it came to renewable power projects.",
    "In these circumstances, where the atrocious practices of the past that brought the country to its present plight continue, where the economic crisis and the way forward are not being discussed with the people, elections and a fresh mandate are needed by those who head the government. There is a need to wipe clean the slate, and also hold Provincial Council Elections that devolve power to a level closer to the affected people, sooner rather than later to provide people with the government and problem solvers they deserve.",
