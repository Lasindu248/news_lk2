    "Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando today threw a challenge at the Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa to mediate between the Sri Lankan government and the three Middle Eastern countries that promised to supply fuel at a concessionary conditions so that Sri Lanka could get fuel immediately.",
    "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to these three countries which have promised you to provide fuel and get it for the nation? You can earn the credit for it,\u201d Mr. Fernando said.",
    "In his retaliation, Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said, \u201cThe Chief Government Whip should know that it is only government to government agreements are signed and there is no norm in the world that agreements are signed between governments and opposition parties.\"",
    "Mr. Fernando then shot back saying Mr. Premadasa could gain some political mileage now by getting fuel from the three countries. \u201cYou can get some political mileage by getting some fuel now, because no one knows when an SJB government will come to power.",
    "The verbal tussle between Mr. Premadasa and Mr. Fernando flared up when the former questioned the recent\u00a0 cabinet approval given to an Indian company to establish a Maritime Rescue Centre.",
    "Mr. Fernando said Mr. Premadasa should raise any question under Standing Order 27 (2).",
    "\u201cWe will answer only if a question is raised under Standing Order 27(2),\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
