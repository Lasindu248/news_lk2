  "body_lines": [
    "While expressing confidence that there is no shortage of petrol in the country, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara said today that Diesel shortage would continue for a few more days as supplying Diesel to fuel sheds has to be restricted as more diesel is being released for power generation at present.",
    "He told Parliament that more Diesel released for power generation after the breakdown of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant to maintain power cut for three hours and twenty minutes.",
    "The Minister said 4,000 MT of Diesel usually released to petrol sheds daily, whereas only 1000 to 1500 MT are supplied at present despite sufficient stocks in hand.",
    "He said however, 3,000 MT of petrol was released to fuel sheds at present.",
    "The Minister said queues for petrol would ease within next three days and added that current queues for petrol were due to recent strikes by fuel bowsers, technical and management issues. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
