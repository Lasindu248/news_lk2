    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A power failure at a consular services office in Colombo, Sri Lanka, resulted in a commotion as visitors, already frustrated over daily power cuts islandwide, reacted in anger.",
    "Local news channels showed footage of impatient patrons loudly demanding that services resume.",
    "The incident occurred at the Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs located in the Ceylinco building in Colombo Fort.",
    "\u201cWe are situated in a third-party building and the power cut was a result of them having not settled their electricity bills,\u201d a spokesperson at the Consular Services office said.",
    "\u201cThe people were outraged because the power cut inconvenienced their work.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is in the midst of one of the worst energy crises in the country\u2019s history, with daily power cuts as long as seven and a half hours in some areas as the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) struggles to find fuel to generate thermal power in the absence of rain for hydro power generation.",
    "The crisis is the result of an ongoing fuel shortage which in turn has been caused by a severe forex shortage brought about by excess money printing to keep interest rates low in a pegged exchange rate regime (Colombo/Mar07/2022)"
