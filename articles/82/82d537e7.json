    "In a fresh twist on the on-going political impasse, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa today wrote to leaders of all parties represented in Parliament to form a unitary Government.",
    "In the letter Rajapaksa has said he is agreeable in principle to form an all-party government with the participation of all parties represented in Parliament.",
    "A meeting has been scheduled for Friday to discuss the structure of the proposed new unitary government to be formed following the resignation of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Cabinet.",
    "Political analysts however questioned whether the President\u2019s move is legitimate whilst Mahinda on the basis of the people\u2019s mandate received at 2020 General Election has been defiant that he will not step down despite calls for his resignation from political factions within the Government and outside.",
    "The latest development also comes amidst a main Opposition SJB-championed no confidence motion against the Government and people\u2019s outcry #Gohomegota."
