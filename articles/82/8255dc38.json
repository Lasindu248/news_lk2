    "The Russian onslaught has sparked massive dislocations, forcing many Ukrainian women to carry their little ones and flee their homes to neighbouring countries. UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten thinks, \u2018it is also putting women at heightened risk of hostility\u2019.\u00a0 She continued, \u201cUnless the conflict stops, thousands of families will be compulsorily displaced, dramatically increasing the scale of the already dreadful humanitarian situation, and growing risk of sexual violence and abuse.\u201d The involvement of women themselves in the decision-making processes and caring response is therefore necessary to ensure that their civil rights and privileges are sustained.",

    "The history is full of occurrences where women have made remarkable contributions to their societies. Women have played multiple roles in wars over the centuries, while keeping the home fires burning\u2014 they have supported the forces with domestic labour in the early 18th Century, and engaged in nursing positions at the frontline too. Thousands of women volunteered as nurses and participated in war work during the First World War.\u00a0 Many life-saving procedures they often carried out in spite of working in awful conditions. Due to the huge numbers of enrolled men, more vital roles, including work on the railways, police, factory-work had been entrusted to them.\u00a0 In the upper classes, women supported the war endeavour by stitching uniforms for troops. Women\u2019s roles extended greatly two decades later, during the World War II. Millions of women were working to provide the military with, ships, aircraft and ammunition. Women were also asked to enlist in military ranks, and seventy per cent of women who joined the army were volunteers. Young single women rushed to work free for the Voluntary Aid Detachment and the British Red Cross.",

As the Buddha entered her chamber, where she was resting dressed in uncaring fabrics, she was unable to hold her respect. For a moment she failed to remember that the man whom she loved most was now the Buddha, she held him by his feet and cried desperately.",

    "At the turn of the twentieth century, the activities of labour movements in the Americas and Europe caused the birth of International Women\u2019s Day. It has assumed a new worldwide dimension for women in both the developed and developing countries. The increased strength in international women\u2019s groups backed by several United Nations women\u2019s conferences has helped as a rallying point to bolster and sustain women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 One of the earliest feminist movements, \u2018Women\u2019s Liberation\u2019 has been a continuing encounter for over one and a half centuries.

    "When popular male celebrities perform on stage, young lasses who are fanatic music fans invade the stage. They embrace, hug and kiss them; throw their lingerie at them. This weird habit, a frequent occurrence in the Western music world, was once enacted in Sri Lanka as well. Will a male ever think of behaving in such an irregular way? Why do they surrender their chastity to a male through such absurd behaviour and later cry foul?",
    "They should bear in mind that it is the self-esteem and decorum of their womanhood that upholds a dignified position for them in the society. They should not plead, appeal, beg, or grovel. They must courageously stand together, and struggle collectively. International Women\u2019s Day is an occasion to reflect on past progresses. No man can make a woman feel inferior without her consent.",
