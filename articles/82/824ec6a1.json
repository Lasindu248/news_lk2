    "The contribution will be channelled through the Italian Bilateral Emergency Fund at the World Health Organization (WHO) and will allow payment to suppliers abroad directly as per planned procurement by MoH in line with the supply chain management process, the Embassy of Italy in Colombo said in a statement issued on Monday (April 25).",

    "\u201cIn the past, Italy has always been ready to support Sri Lanka whenever the country was in need, including in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. In addition, Italy has supported initiatives aimed at strengthening the agriculture sector (ICEI/Institute for International Economic Cooperation project in the Moneragala area and \u2018Smallholder productivity enhancement in Sri Lankan agriculture\u2019 project, currently under discussion) and providing professional training to young Sri Lankans (\u2018SPOSA\u2019 project for social workers and caretakers in the Chilaw area).\u201d"
