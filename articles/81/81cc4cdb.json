    "A protest broke out, outside UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe's house in 5th Lane in Colombo this morning, with protestors calling on the former prime minister to 'Go Home' and 'Stay Home'.",
    "The protestors gathered outside after a statement made by TNA MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam in Parliament this week, saying that Ranil was seen persuading opposition MPs to vote for SLFP's Ranjith Siyambalapitiya in the Deputy Speaker election.",
    "The protestors gathered outside Ranil's house and carried out a peaceful protest calling on Ranil to allegedly stop his 'deals'.",
    "An hour into the protest, a group of Ranil's supporters also gathered at the site and began a protest saying the only solution to the ongoing crisis was to appoint Ranil as a leader. An argument then erupted between the pro and anti Ranil protestors and the police had to calm the situation.",
    "A message was later sent to the protestors by the former prime minister saying if they wished to meet him, they should come to the Sirikotha on Monday where he will discuss their concerns with them. The protestors eventually dispersed. (Jamila Husain)"
