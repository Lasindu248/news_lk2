    "There is a possibility of announcing the bus fare revision from Monday night (14) onwards, Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "He said the decision was taken following lengthy discussions with the Finance Minister and bus owners' associations.",
    "The discussions were held exploring the possibility of granting fuel subsidy for private buses, but the discussions proved it was not practical, the Minister said.",
    "Later, the discussion focused on providing a bus fare revision, he said.",
    "The bus owners have agreed that they were not in favour of the bus fare hike as was during the previous instance indicating that the recent diesel price increase was by Rs.55, and it was a huge amount, Minister Amunugama said.",
    "The bus associations agreed not to go for a higher fare revision and to make it on par with the new diesel price increase by CYPETCO.",
    "There is a 45 rupee difference between CYPETCO and Lanka IOC. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
