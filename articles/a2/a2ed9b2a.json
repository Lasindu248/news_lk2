Historically Sri Lanka has had around $ 10 billion trade deficit, which is significant. This gap is what is causing damage to the rupee today,\u201d he added. Following the sharp devaluation of the rupee by nearly 30% under a free-float regime, prices of several more products and services were jacked up.",
