    "The United States in its latest travel advisory on Wednesday has cautioned its citizens from travelling to Sri Lanka amid the ongoing economic crisis and unrest in the country. Pointing to the fuel and medicine shortages in Sri Lanka, the US' new advisory also mentioned terror threats as a concern.",
    "\u201cReconsider travel to Sri Lanka due to COVID-19 and fuel and medicine shortages. Exercise increased caution in Sri Lanka due to terrorism,\u201d said the State Department said in its latest travel advisory",
    "\u201cThere have recently been protests over the economic situation and queues at gas stations, grocery stores and some pharmacies. Protests have occurred throughout the country and have mostly been peaceful. In some instances, police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters,\" the advisory said.",
    "Mentioning the power outages in the nation, the advisory further said, \u201cThere have also been daily planned power outages across the island, as well as some unplanned power outages, as fuel for backup generators is increasingly scarce. Public transportation in some instances has been limited or curtailed. Travellers should monitor local media for updates on the ongoing situation.\u201d",
    "\"Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas, the travel advisory said.",
    "Meanwhile, the US has also issued a level-3 travel health notice for Sri Lanka due to Covid-19. The 'level-3' indicated a high level of coronavirus cases in the country. \u201cYour risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorised vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC's specific recommendations for vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers,\u201d said the travel advisory."
