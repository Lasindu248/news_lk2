  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Immigration and Emigration Department has seen in a significant increase in new passports issued, with 31,725 passports issued in the first 10 days of June alone, a threefold increase.",
    "Media Spokesperson of the Department of Immigration and Emmigration Piyumi Bandara told \u00a0EconomyNext that, in the 10 days that preceded June 01, only 10,000 new passports had been issued.",
    "\u201cPassports are being issued rapidly. Normally under one-day service we only issue 2,500 passports, but now we have increased that to 3,500 new issues.\u201d",
    "One day services now costs 15,000 rupees, with the original prices revised back in July 2020.",
    "\u201cFor 15,000 rupees to get my passport in one day, I don\u2019t mind, as long as I can leave,\u201d a frustrated person in the passport queue said.",
    "The rise in demand has led the department\u2019s services being split to two separate shifts, with one shift taking place from 7am to 2pm and the next from 2pm to 10pm.",
    "Passport issue congestion has led to alternatives being taken up, where passports will be issued in all District Secretariats from the beginning of next year, officials said. The Public Administration and Management Ministry anticipate this move will reduce clogs in within the department.",
    "Many have resorted to fleeing the country due to Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis, with exorbitant price increments and scarcity of essentials going making life increasingly hard to the middle classes and below.",
    "\u201cThis was a livable country, but now all I think about is leaving. I have been pondering over this decision since 2019 after the Easter attacks, when national security was our biggest issue. But fast forward three years and we\u2019re at our worst after Independence,\u201d Anthony Fernando of Mount Lavinia said.",
    "Fernando, a father to two that works at a well-known conglomerate as a senior consultant, blamed the economic crisis brought about by severe mismanagement on people\u2019s desire to migrate.",
    "However, Fernando is hopeful of Sri Lanka returning to normal eventually as the western country he plans to move to is never going to be a place he can call home, he said.",
    "\u201cI want to come back after and see the change. It takes time for change to be implemented, but sooner or later. I want to come back to the island which is a place of growth and stability,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Jun13/2022)"
