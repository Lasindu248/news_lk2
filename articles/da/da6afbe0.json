  "body_lines": [
    "Tomorrow the United Nations marks World Environment Day 2022 and the issues, precepts and principles are so important that we should effectively and actively participate in the battle against climate change. Literally it is a do-or-die crisis because if it is not tackled on a worldwide scale, the generations to come will be forced to breathe poison and suffer the physical and mental consequences. Beautiful and wonderful nature itself will be distorted while the delicate biodiversity will make it difficult if not impossible for people to live in a happy and healthy way.",
    "In a statement the UN says in our galaxy are billions of planets but there is only one earth and we need to take care of it. According to the UN the earth faces a triple planetary emergency: the climate is heating up too quickly for people and nature to adapt; habitat loss and other pressures mean an estimated 1 million species are threatened with extinction while pollution continues to poison our air, land and water. The way out of this dilemma is to transform our economies and societies to make them inclusive, fair and more connected with nature. We must shift from harming the planet to healing it.",
    "Truly transformative options towards sustainability need to be available, affordable and attractive for people to make better daily decisions. Key areas for transformation include how we build and live in our homes, cities and places of work and worship, how and where our money is invested, and what we do for fun. But others of greater magnitude also include: energy production systems, global trade and transport systems, and protection of biodiversity. Many of these options can only be created by larger entities: national and sub-national governments, financial institutions, businesses, international organisations, and other groups with the power to rewrite the rules, frame our ambition and open up new horizons. Nevertheless, individuals and civil society are pivotal advocates, awareness-raisers and supporters. The more we raise our voices, emphasize what needs to be done and point out who is responsible, the faster change will come. By supporting World Environment Day 2022 and the #OnlyOneEarth campaign, you can help ensure this unique and beautiful planet remains a comfortable home for humanity, the UN says.",
    "In Sri Lanka many groups are working in creating awareness of the need for us to maintain a clean earth. One such movement is named the \u201cStewards of Creation\u201d. Today the movement will conduct an ecumenical service at St. Paul\u2019s church in Milagiriya.\u00a0 In a statement the movement quotes the UN statement World Environment Day Campaign\u00a0 #OnlyOneEarth and calls for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet.",
    "Today people from all parts of Sri Lanka will come together for a time of worship, repentance and renewal of our commitment to preserve, protect and renew God\u2019s creation. The trilingual ecumenical service will begin at 5PM and will be live-streamed on Youtube. The movement\u2019s main coordinator is social-justice advocate Sharmini Wickremeratne.",
    "According to the UN we are using the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to maintain our current way of life, and ecosystems cannot keep up with our demands. Our lifestyles are associated with two thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions - studies show that sustainable lifestyles and behaviours could reduce our emissions by 40% to 70% by 2050. Sustainable consumption and production can drive economic development, mitigate climate change, positively impact health and pollution, and help alleviate poverty \u2013 potentially increasing incomes by an average of 11% in low- and medium-income countries by 2060, and 4% in high-income countries.",
    "Time is running out, and nature is in emergency mode. To keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C this century, we must halve annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Without action, exposure to air pollution beyond safe guidelines will increase by 50 per cent within the decade and plastic waste flowing into aquatic ecosystems will nearly triple by 2040. We need urgent action to address these pressing issues, making \u201cOnly One Earth\u201d and its focus on living sustainably in harmony with nature, as pertinent as ever.",
    "According to former United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt a nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people. Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has pointed out that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth are one and the same fight. We must connect the issues between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women\u2019s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all."
