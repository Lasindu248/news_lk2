  "title": "Sri Lanka opposition calls for accountability for monetary excesses, default",
  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition has called for accountability for currency monetary instability and default, after the country stopped paying foreign debt after running down foreign reserves under \u2018flexible\u2019 or highly discretionary policies.",
    "Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya legislator said the default was required because the country had run out of options.  The SJB had been calling for re-profiling of debt for around two years as well as an International Monetary Fund bailout.",
    "Sri Lanka is a top customer of the IMF due to its soft-pegged reserve collecting exchange rate regime with anchor conflicts (impossible trinity regime), which is now called a \u2018flexible\u2019 exchange rate.",
    "Forex shortages and balance of payment trouble take place in soft-pegged exchange rate regimes, when \u2018economists\u2019 target a policy rate with open market operations.",
    "Forex shortages are impossible in a clean float as convertibility is completely suspended (no surrender requirements, no reserves for imports) and the monetary base becomes \u2018sealed\u2019.",
    "There are energy and medicine shortages from the \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019 now as well as default.",
    "\u201cI regret from the bottom of my heart that it has come to this point,\u201d de Silva said in a statement.",
    "\u201cBut the people who brought the country to this point must be punished.\u201d",
    "As a legislator de Silva can change the monetary law to make it impossible for economists to print money and operate discretionary \u2018flexible\u2019 inflation targeting or \u2018flexible inflation targeting\u2019 and prevent currency crises in the future with a single anchor regime (either a clean float or a hard peg).",
    "De Silva had earlier called for accountability of the previous monetary board or governing council of the central bank.",
    "On March 31, de Silva called for the \u201ccomplete overhaul of the monetary board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as confidence in the current board is destroyed.",
    "\u201cWe are facing this current crisis, as a result of ill decisions made by the monetary board.\u201d",
    "Two of the members of the monetary board have since been re-appointed. De Silva has however praised most decisions of the new central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe including a steep rate hike.",
    "De Silva\u2019s plan for a \u2018social market economy\u2019 in 2015 which required a strong exchange rate to protect the savings of the family economy and their salaries through low inflation was shattered by a previous monetary board.",
    "Sri Lanka needs Central Bank reforms for a Social Market Economy: Bellwether",
    "Sri Lanka heading for Sozialpolitik not a social market economy : Bellwether",
    "Hayek\u2019s warning: lost generation economics kill Sri Lanka\u2019s social market economy attempt: Bellwether",
    "Analysts had warned at the time that it would not be social market economy but Weimar Republic style social democracy that would occure with multiple anchor monetary regime involving, call money rate targeting, REER targeting and output gap targeting.",
    "In 2015 and 2016, the central bank printed money as budget deficits exploded under a \u2018100 day program\u2019 creating a currency crisis which drove the rupee down from 131 to 151 until monetary breaks were imposed.",
    "In 2018 money was printed despite taxes being raised and budget deficits being brought down creating a currency crisis which took the rupee down from 152 to 182 and made the then administration a laughing stock by bringing in import controls.",
    "Deposit rate controls were also imposed on poor people\u2019s savings after depreciating the currency in merciless zero-sum Mercantilist interventionism (competitive exchange rate or inflationist-devaluationism) to giving short-lived porfits to producers at the expense of the working class and social unrest.",
    "The rupee has fallen from 182 to 335 so far after two years of money printing and a deadly surrender requirement.",
    "Legislators have themselves given the central bank powers imposed exchange controls and surrender requirements undermining people\u2019s basic freedoms. (Colombo/Apr13/2022)"
