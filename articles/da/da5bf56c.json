    "A group of protestors gathered outside UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe's house in 5th Lane in Colombo today morning, with protestors calling on him to stay home. The protestors gathered after allegations by TNA MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam in Parliament this week saying Ranil was seen persuading opposition MPs to vote for the government backed Ranjith Siyambalapitya in the Deputy Speaker election."
