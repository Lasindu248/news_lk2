    "Due to not revising the fuel transport formula, the Sri Lanka Petroleum Private Tanker Owners' Association (SLPPTOA) has decided to refrain from distributing fuel from midnight today.",
    "The Association's Secretary, Shantha Silva told the Daily Mirror that they had requested the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Managing Director that they needed to revise the fuel transport formula within two days considering the recent diesel fuel price hike or else they would refrain from carrying out their services.",
    "The association had requested that the transport formula be revised to account for the 60% increase in transportation costs caused by the CYPETCO fuel price increase.",
    "Accordingly, a total of 800 bowsers operating on fuel distribution will be suspended from tonight. According to him, the CYPETCO only has 70 to 80 bowsers in operation.",
    "The sudden increase in fuel by CYPETCO, the prices of lubricants, tyres, tubes, batteries, vehicle service charges, vehicle spare parts, and employee salaries have all shot up. Silva said 90% of the members have decided to stop the fuel distribution.",
    "He claimed the bowsers were unable to get diesel, for fuel distribution. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
