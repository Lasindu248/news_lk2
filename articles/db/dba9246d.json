    "Certain people controlling the economy of this country have lost the people's confidence and must stand down, former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardena said.",
    "In a statement, he said these problems are man-made and can be fixed by the right, qualified people.",
    "\"We then need a good team to give the country confidence and belief. There is no time to waste. It is time to be humble, not make excuses and to do the right thing,\" he said.",
    "\"I'm sad to see emergency law and curfew in Sri Lanka. The government cannot ignore the needs of the people who have every right to protest,",
    "\"Detaining people who do is not acceptable and I am very proud of the brave Sri Lankan lawyers who rushed to their defence. True leaders own up to mistakes.",
    "There is massive urgency here to protect the people of our country, united in their suffering,\" the statement added."
