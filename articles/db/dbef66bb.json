    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s newly appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he will talk to countries like India and Japan for assistance to avert a hunger crisis and help get the island nation back on its feet, but the country\u2019s dire economic situation will get worse before it gets better.",
    "Wickremesinghe told BBC World News on Friday (13) that he will ensure that the public will get three meals a day.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, but I\u2019m going to meet that challenge and overcome it,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka is going through the worst economic crisis in its 74-year post-Independence history. A crippling shortage of foreign reserves has led to ever lengthening queues for fuel, cooking gas and other essentials while scheduled power cuts and soaring food prices heap misery on the people.",
    "The economic crisis also triggered a political crisis in Sri Lanka, culminating in the resignation of ex-Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa under violent circumstances followed by the shotgun appointment of Wickremesinghe as the country\u2019s 26th prime minister.",
    "Speaking to the BBC, Wickremesinghe said his first task is to determine the extent of the damage.",
    "\u201cFirst [job] is to find out how bad the economy is. No one has got all the details. So I will be like a doctor, who is opening up the patient for the first time. I know there are issues. We\u2019ve got to deal with the IMF. We\u2019ve got to find money to get through this year,\u201d he said.",
    "Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe told the media on Wednesday (11) that Sri Lanka\u2019s remaining usable foreign reserves were enough for about a week\u2019s worth of imports. The central bank chief also said Sri Lanka will have to print money to pay state worker salaries unless taxes were raised.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m also speaking to friendly nations to come and assist us with bridging finance. We\u2019ve also get to create an atmosphere for foreign investment,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "Responding to a question by the BBC journalist about India, he said: \u201cYes, India has been helping us. But we\u2019ll talk to others, to Japan, to South Korea.\u201d",
    "The new prime minister held discussions with diplomats representing India, Japan, China, the US, the UK about forming a foreign aid consortium to help navigate Sri Lanka through its unprecedented forex crisis.",
    "Asked about fuel shortages in the country, Wickremesinghe said \u201cnot much\u201d is left.",
    "\u201cI will have to have some scheme of rationing this time. We\u2019ve got to get assistance. We\u2019re talking with India and ensure that there\u2019s fuel available in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said. Petrol and diesel queues that extend for hundres of metres have become a common sight in Sri Lanka.",
    "Wickremesinghe said his immediate goal is to ensure continued supply of food, fuel and medicine.",
    "\u201cIt is going to get worse before it gets better. I\u2019m looking for all the details, so I could tell the people of Sri Lanka \u2018this is the position and this is what we\u2019re planning to do in the coming months.\u2019 I will somehow ensure there is sufficient food, fuel and medicine available,\u201d he said.",
    "When pressed about how he proposes to do this, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to look for help from outside and talk to them.\u201d",
    "\u201cAfter I speak to [friendly nations], there will be help coming from there. They won\u2019t allow people to starve.\u201d",
    "The new PM claimed MPs from both sides in parliament wanted him to tackle the economic situation. However major opposition parties and some independent groups from the former government have expressly denied their support.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s major opposition parties refuse to work with new PM Ranil Wickremesinghe",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to change many of the policies of the Rajapaksa government,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not going to look at the books. I want to see how bad the situation is. How the real economy is functioning, what is left in the central bank. I know the books are cooked. I can\u2019t look at it at the moment. But what the economy is, I will look. One is the monetary side of it. We\u2019re dealing with the IMF on the monetary side. But the real economy is not functioning.\u201d",
    "He refused to give a timeline on when Sri Lankans can expect a respite.",
    "\u201cI will tell them, be patient, but gradually I will bring it back.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not giving ]a timeline]. Once I settle the thing and I speak to the other country\u2019s, I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked what his message would be to the rest of the world,\u00a0 Wickremesinghe said: \u201cWe are getting back on our feet. We need your assistance for a year. Whatever we get from you, we\u2019ll repay. Certainly. Help us to do it. We\u2019re the longest and oldest democracy in Asia.\u201d (Colombo/May14/2022)"
