    "COLOMBO; Last week, Indian PM Narendra Modi told US President Joe Biden that India was ready to ship food to the rest of the world following supply shocks and rising prices due to the war in Ukraine.",
    "Modi said India had \u201cenough food\u201d for its 1.4 billion people, and it was \u201cready to supply food stocks to the world from tomorrow\u201d if the World Trade Organization (WTO) allowed.",
    "Commodity prices were already at a 10-year high before the war in Ukraine because of global harvest issues. They have leaped after the war and are already at their highest since 1990, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (UNFAO) food-price index.",
    "Russia and Ukraine are two of the world\u2019s major wheat exporters and account for about a third of global annual wheat sales. The two countries also account for 55% of the global annual sunflower oil exports, and 17% of exports of maize and barley. Together, they were expected to export 14 million tonnes of wheat and over 16 million tonnes of maize this year, according to UNFAO.",
    "\u201cThe supply disruptions and threat of embargo facing Russia mean that these exports have to be taken out of the equation. India could step in to export more, especially when it has enough stocks of wheat,\u201d says Upali Galketi Aratchilage, a Rome-based economist at UNFAO.",
    "India is the second-biggest producer of rice and wheat in the world. As of early April, it had 74 million tonnes of the two staples in stock. Of this, 21 million tonnes have been kept for its strategic reserve and the Public Distribution System (PDS), which gives more than 700 million poor people access to cheap food.",
    "India is also one of the cheapest global suppliers of wheat and rice: it is already exporting rice to nearly 150 countries and wheat to 68. It exported some 7 million tonnes of wheat in 2020-2021. Traders, reacting to rising demand in the international market, have already entered contracts for exports of more than 3 million tonnes of wheat from April to July, according to officials. Farm exports exceeded a record $50bn in 2021-22.",
    "India can export 22 million tonnes of rice and 16 million tonnes of wheat in this fiscal year, according to Ashok Gulati, a professor of agriculture at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. \u201cIf the WTO allows government stocks to be exported, it can be even higher. This will help cool the global prices and reduce the burden of importing countries around the world,\u201d he says.",
    "There are some reservations though. \u201cWe have enough stocks at the moment. But there are some concerns, and we should not become gung-ho about feeding the world,\u201d says Harish Damodaran, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi-based think tank.",
    "First, there are fears of a less-than-expected harvest. India\u2019s new wheat season is underway and officials project a record 111 million tonnes be harvested \u2013 the sixth bumper crop season in a row.",
    "But experts like Damodaran are not convinced. He believes the yield will be much lower because of fertilizer shortages and the vagaries of the weather \u2013 excessive rains and severe early summer heat. \u201cWe are overestimating the production,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will know in another 10 days.\u201d",
    "Another question mark, say, experts, is over fertilizers, a basic component of farming. India\u2019s stocks have fallen low after the war \u2013 India imports di-ammonium phosphate and fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphate, sulfur, and potash. Russia and Belarus account for 40% of the world\u2019s potash exports. Globally, fertilizer prices are already high due to soaring gas prices.",
    "A shortage of fertilizers could easily hit production in the next harvest season. One way to get around this, says Damodaran, is for India to explore \u201cwheat-for-fertilizer deals\u201d with countries like Egypt and Africa.",
    "Also, if the war gets prolonged, India might face logistical challenges in stepping up exports. \u201cExporting huge volumes of cereals involves huge infrastructure like transportation, storage, ships. Also the capacity to start shipping in high volumes,\u201d says Aratchilage. There is also the question of higher freight costs.",
    "Lastly, there is the overriding concern over galloping food prices at home \u2013 food inflation hit a 16-month-high of 7.68% in March. This has been mainly driven by price rises of edible oils, vegetables, cereals, milk, meat, and fish. India\u2019s central bank has warned about \u201celevated global price pressures in key food items\u201d leading to \u201chigh uncertainty\u201d over inflation.",
    "The Russian invasion is likely to have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for global food security, according to IFPRI, a think tank. The UNFAO estimates that a prolonged disruption to exports of wheat, fertilizer, and other commodities from Russia and Ukraine could push up the number of undernourished people in the world from eight to 13 million.",
    "By the government\u2019s admission, more than three million children remain undernourished in India despite bountiful crops and ample food stocks. (Prime Minister Modi\u2019s native state, Gujarat, has the third-highest number of such children.) \u201cYou cannot be cavalier about food security. You cannot play around with the food earmarked for the subsidized food system,\u201d says Damodaran.",
    "If there is one thing India\u2019s politicians know it is that food \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 determines their fate: state and federal governments have tumbled in the past because of soaring onion prices."
