    "\"It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis,\" he said in the video. \"As you can see this eye is not blinking. I can't smile on this side of my face; this nostril will not move. So there's full paralysis on this side of my face.\"",
    "According to the Mayo Clinic, Ramsay Hunt syndrome \"occurs when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near one of your ears. In addition to the painful shingles rash, Ramsay Hunt syndrome can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss in the affected ear.\"",
