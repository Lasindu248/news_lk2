    "\u201cI saw the video of the said incident, and it was observed that the Army Registration Number placed on the side and back of the motorbikes,\u201d he told the Parliament while calling for an investigation to determine if the team of Army Riders arrived on their own or if they were sent to the location of the protest.",
    "At the same time, the Former Army Commander strongly condemned the actions of the Police Officers who were seen berating a uniformed soldier in the presence of the public.",
    "\u201cIf the same happens to a Police Officer, I would side with the victim,\u201d he said while noting that as a Senior Ranked Military Officer he does not approve of the presence of Army Riders at a protest location.",
    "\u201cA person could have snatched the weapon and shot the soldier,\u201d he told the house, adding that the movement of soldiers in such places is not wise.",
