    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka claimed \u201coverwhelming\u201d and cross-regional support, particularly from the global south, at the interactive dialogue at the 49th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva that ended on Monday (07), as Western countries noted setbacks on the human rights front and called for increased engagement with minority political parties.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka received overwhelming support from countries of the global south who expressed support for the government\u2019s significant efforts towards reconciliation and reiterated the importance of objective and constructive cooperation as the fundamental basis for multilateral engagement,\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday (08).",
    "Of the 45 countries that spoke at the Interactive Dialogue on the written update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka, the ministry said, 31 spoke in support of the island nation",
    "\u201cSri Lanka received cross-regional support from a broad spectrum of states of South, South East and Central Asia and the African Group. The 31 countries that spoke in favour of Sri Lanka were Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Philippines, Nepal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Maldives, China, Cuba, Japan, Syrian Arab Republic, Viet Nam, DPRK, Venezuela, Nigeria, Pakistan, Cambodia, the Russian Federation, Lebanon, Uganda, Belarus, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, South Sudan, Lao PDR, Yemen, Iran, Niger, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh and Azerbaijan,\u201d the statement noted.",
    "Reiterating the foreign ministry\u2019s position, Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet spokesman and Media Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said on Tuesday that the support received was a mark of progress.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re a government that respects fundamental rights. Do not have any doubt about that.",
    "\u201cOf the [47] member states of the UNHRC, 31 have appreciated the positive steps taken by the government in protecting human rights. That\u2019s progress,\u201d the minister said.",
    "He added that Sri Lanka is hopeful UNHRC will recognise the positive and progressive steps the government has taken in addressing human rights concerns, pointing to mechanisms in place to investigate the disappearances of over 14,000 Sri Lankans since the late 1980s.",
    "\u201cFor the first time, a proper solution has been proposed and a mechanism devised, and steps are being taken to expedite it. I think there should be some appreciation of that in the UNHRC.",
    "\u201cWe look at this positively and trust that they understand it,\u201d said Alahapperuma.",
    "However, the United States, which recently joined the core group of countries on Sri Lanka that includes the United Kingdom, called for increased engagement with Tamil and Muslim parties and civil society organisations to \u201cadvance an inclusive, lasting political solution\u201d.",
    "The UK, meanwhile, noting continued lack of progress on accountability and \u201csetbacks in several emblematic human rights cases\u201d, called on the Sri Lankan government to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 passed in March 2021 and to cooperate with the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner (OHCHR).",
    "Welcoming the release on bail of poet Ahnaf Jazeem and attorney-at-law Hejaaz Hizbullah as a positive first step, UK global ambassador for human rights Rita French said reforms proposed for the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) do not go far enough.",
    "\u201cWhilst we acknowledge the NGO Secretariat move to the Foreign Ministry, we have concerns around surveillance and harassment of civil society, and militarisation of civilian governmental functions. The appointment of an individual, named in a key emblematic case, to the post of Provincial Governor, is particularly worrying,\u201d French said.",
    "\u201cWhilst we acknowledge ongoing work in Government institutions on reparations and missing persons, it is crucial this is accompanied by a comprehensive reconciliation and accountability process,\u201d she added.",
    "French also claimed that minority communities are facing increased marginalisation, with allegations of land grabs in the North and East of the country.",
    "The foreign ministry statement said Minister G L Peiris addressing UNHRC at the start of the interactive dialogue last Friday (0r), while reiterating Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to continuing its voluntary international undertakings on human rights and engaging with the United Nations, including the UNHRC, referred to serious anomalies and weaknesses in the update presented by the High Commissioner.
