    "Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB) is to start street\u00a0 battles to remove President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government from power tomorrow, SJB MP Harin Fernando said today.",
    "MP Fernando told a press conference that the biggest ever protest march which Sri Lanka has ever seen will begin today from Kandy. \u201cWe will begin the protest march after worshiping the Dala Maligawa and we will reach Colombo on May 1. SJB will then begin the exercise to chase the President and the government out of power. We will reveal the venue where we begin our struggle in Colombo later,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe gave an ultimatum of one month to the government to resolve issues faced by the nation on March 15. That one month is up now. Therefore the time is up for the struggle to oust this government from power. Everyone will be able to see what we are going to do on May 1, 2022,\u201d he added.",
    "He said SJB will get on with the struggle even if every protester is arrested and sent to jail. \u201cWe are not afraid to go to jail for the people,\u201d he\u00a0 added. (By Yohan Perera)"
