    "Better late than never, they say, and in the mail, a few days back, I had a little note from a friend, working in Oman, regarding the two events, held in Oman, on the 10th and 11th of March, featuring Rajiv and The Clan and a few other artistes, from Sri Lanka, and a performer, from Oman, as well.",
    "My friend was there for both events and gave me a description as to what took place, especially at the dance.",
    "According to my friend, Rajiv and The Clan kept everyone happy, on the dance floor, with the right kind of music for dancing.",
    "However, he said, some of the other performers gave the impression that they were more concerned about projecting their image, and their creations, and didn\u2019t quite come up with the appropriate music\u2026for dancing.",
    "He also mentioned that the music, from them, was not continuous and that dancers were kept idling on the dance floor\u2026as these artistes planned out their next song!",
    "He went on to say that this would have been okay, at a stage show, but not at a dance!",
    "I guess the new facesneed to learn the difference, when performing at a stage show, and at a dance!",
