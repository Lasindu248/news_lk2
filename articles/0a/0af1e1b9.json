    "The vote was held past midnight after opposition parties brought a motion against him, which was upheld by the Supreme Court.",
    "Mr Khan had said he would not recognise an opposition government, claiming - without evidence - that there was a US-led conspiracy to remove him.",
    "Pakistan\u2019s parliament will meet to vote for the country\u2019s new leader on Monday.",
    "That person will be able to hold power until October 2023, when the next election is due to be held.",

    "Mr Khan becomes the first Pakistani prime minister to be ousted by a no-confidence vote.",
    "The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Mr Khan, 69, had acted unconstitutionally when he blocked the no-confidence vote and dissolved parliament.",
    "This made several opposition members furious, with some accusing the prime minister of treason.",
    "Minutes before the vote started, the speaker of Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament - an ally of Mr Khan - announced his resignation. Members of Mr Khan\u2019s party (PTI) left the building, insisting he was the victim of an international conspiracy.",
    "Opposition parties were able to secure 174 votes in the 342-member house in support of the no-confidence motion, the house speaker said, making it a majority vote.",

    "In late March a series of defections deprived him of his majority and left him fighting for his political career.",
    "The BBC\u2019s Secunder Kermani says Mr Khan is widely regarded as having come to power with the help of Pakistan\u2019s army, but now observers say they have fallen out.",
    "Mr Khan has repeatedly said that Pakistan\u2019s opposition parties are working with foreign powers. He also claims that he is the target of a US-led conspiracy to remove him because of his refusal to stand with Washington on issues against Russia and China.",
    "The US has said there was \u201cno truth\u201d in these allegations, and Mr Khan has never provided any evidence.",
    "He visited Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin as Russia was launching the invasion of Ukraine and has previously criticised what the Bush administration called the war on terror.",
    "Saturday\u2019s vote came after opposition lawmakers put forward a no-confidence motion to parliament last Sunday, in a bid to oust Mr Khan from power.",
    "But parliament\u2019s deputy speaker Qasim Suri - a member of Mr Khan\u2019s political party - swiftly blocked the vote, saying it showed \u201cforeign interference\u201d. Mr Suri also said that it went against the constitution, which calls for loyalty to the state.",
    "Mr Khan\u2019s government went on to dissolve parliament and called for a snap election to be held. This angered several opposition members, with some accusing the prime minister of treason for blocking the vote.",
    "Opposition figures submitted a petition to the Supreme Court to assess the situation.",
