    "Dry rations and meals provided to employees and their families",
    "In an effort to reduce the burden of the ongoing economic crisis and help workers cope with the rising cost of living, apparel manufacturers have taken measures to provide both financial and non-financial support to their workers. The apparel industry is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export earner and accounts for 40% of the country\u2019s total exports.",
    "\u201cWe are grappling with tough and unprecedented times,\u201d notes Yohan Lawrence, Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF). \u201cOur workers keep the wheels of our industry turning, and their welfare is our top priority. We are encouraging factories to implement welfare measures that best suit the requirements of their workers and are aware that many have already done so. As of now, around 80% of apparel manufacturers have made cost of living adjustments to salaries over and above the annual increments. In some instances, these represent increases of 25% from 2021.",
    "Lawrence also noted that some factories have even initiated welfare schemes for the distribution of dry rations in support of employees across the plants including outsourced services like janitorial, canteen and security staff. Certain factories also provide additional meals for employees to take home so they can help feed their families as well. Other benefits offered to employees, particularly in the SME sector, include the provision of school books for children, free medical facilities and special food packages for pregnant mothers.",
    "\u201cThe livelihoods of our workers are our top priority, and we will take necessary steps to ensure that the disruption on their lives during this difficult period is minimized,\u201d Lawrence iterated.",
