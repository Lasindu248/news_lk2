    "The main opposition, the Samagi Jana Balavegaya, which missed the bus to the premiership on Thursday (12) said Wickremesinghe\u2019s appointment does not reflect the people\u2019s mandate, given the United National Party (UNP)\u2019s humiliating defeat at the 2020 parliamentary polls.",
    "The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which quit the ruling coalition earlier, said it has refused offers to join the new government. SLFP chairman and former President Maithripala Sirisena rejected invitations to take up ministerial portfolios.",
    "A group of former government MPs who have been functioning independently in parliament also said they will not be joining a Rajapaksa-Wickrmesinghe government. The MPs include former ministers Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila were removed by President Rajapaksa from the cabinet.

    "India\u2019s The Hindu quoted him as saying the previous day: \u201cThe President has completely lost legitimacy, people want him to go home, and the Parliament will soon vote on a motion expressing displeasure over him.

    "SJB parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne told reporters on Friday that the new prime minister is a failure just like President Gotabaya Rajapksa.",
    "Wickremesinghe does not have 113MPs to back him, said Senaratne.",
    "\u201cJust like Sir (nickname for the president) failed, so has Ranil,\u201d he said, adding that anti-government protestors gathered outside the presidential secretariat are now calling him Ranil Rajapaksa.",
    "Senaratne claimed the prime minister is serving the interests of the Rajapaksas over those of the people.",
    "The MP explained the SJB\u2019s delay in taking the president up on his offer as an unwillingness to carelessly form a government. Any government taking up the job would have to have a plan in place to resolve the issues of queues and shortages, he said. Thursday morning, the MP said, SJB representatives had spoken to economists and to diplomats to see if securing aid was possible, after which the party had arrived at its decision.
