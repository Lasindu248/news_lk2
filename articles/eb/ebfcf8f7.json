    "COLOMBO (News 1st); If an election is held, it will be free and fair only if there is an environment to support that, says the Chairman of the Elections Commission,\u00a0Attorney-at-Law Nimal G. Punchihewa.",
    "The ECSL Chairman further stated that although the commission currently has only Rs. 5 billion now, the amount will likely increase two to three times.",
    "However, he pointed out that money is not the issue, but there is a question whether those in queues for gas and kerosene can make a decision according to their conscience.",
    "Therefore, he said that Sri Lanka will have to go for an election after the economic crisis is addressed.",
    "\u201cThe people are emotional now. We don\u2019t know how it will affect the outcome of the election. This may lead to various groups of thugs emerging apart from political parties, and it may create security issues at filling stations,\u201d he stated.",
    "Punchihewa said that if an election is to be held now, it will be similar to the district elections in 1982 and the provincial elections in 1999, which is not needed at the moment.",
