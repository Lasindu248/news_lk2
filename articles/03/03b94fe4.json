    "The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will offer the second online course to become certified as a Preventative Controls Qualified Individual (PCQI), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirement in order for firms to export to the US food and beverage market.",
    "The US FDA\u2019s Food Safety Modernisation Act (FSMA) law on \u201cPreventive Controls for Human Food Regulation\u201d aims to prevent foodborne illnesses through the safe preparation of food products for human consumption in the United States. This regulation requires food and beverage production facilities to have at least one Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (PCQI) to lead the creation, application and verification of risk-based preventive controls. A PCQI is critical for an FDA-compliant food safety program.",
    "The three-day, 20-hour course will be offered on 7, 9 and 10 June from 9 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. (IST) each day. On successful completion of this FDA-approved standardised curriculum, participants will receive a Food Safety Preventive Controls Alliance (FSPCA) PCQI certificate recognised by the FDA and issued by the Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO) and the International Food Protection Training Institute. Fulfilling the requirements to be a PCQI is a critical step in exporting food and beverages to the United States.",
