    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa today alleged that he had got threatening calls saying a plan is afoot to remove him from the Opposition Leader\u2019s post if he fails to agree for an interim government.",
    "\u201cI am getting telephone calls 24 hours a day asking me to join an interim government together with other parties in Parliament. There was a threatening call among these. One caller told me that there is a plan to remove me from the opposition leader\u2019s post. I am prepared to resign from the opposition leader\u2019s post as I always have the backing and the sympathy of the common people,\u201d he told a gathering in Mirigama.",
    "\u201cNo one from SJB will join an interim government,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cA political teledrama was unveiled yesterday where there were conflicts within the government parliamentary group. The President had informed the group that he had not asked the Prime Minister to resign. MP Dallas Alahaperuma has said he had associated with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa for a long time, to which the President had replied saying Mr. Rajapaksa became his brother long before Mr. Alahaperuma started associating with him. The government has become a pickle. Now they are requesting us to join an interim government. We are against joining an interim government,\u201d he also said. (Yohan Perera)"
