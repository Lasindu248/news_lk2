  "body_lines": [
    "Introduction: In our attempt to introduce a system change, one of the vital aspects to be ensured is that Ministers of whatever rank, discharge their constitutional obligations with a serious sense of responsibility, granting primacy to national interest above all else. Based on my long years in the Public Service as well as the experience of other Public Officers who have struggled to uphold their commitment to render a service with integrity, it\u2019s clear that there are sacred principles of good governance that sometimes Ministers love to forget or choose to ignore. Accordingly, the following Code of Conduct has been formulated and is recommended for adoption.",
    "While there\u2019s a Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament effective April 2018 which would also apply to Ministers, the following Code is formulated in particular to be made applicable to Ministers in the discharge of their functions.",
    "It\u2019s recommended that Ministers should not only take the oaths required under the Constitution, but also an oath to abide by the provisions of the Code of Conduct.",
