    "JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake came under fire in Parliament today by government MPs who claimed he was instigating violent protests.",
    "Government MPs claimed that Dissanayake was seen chatting to protestors on his way from Parliament on Tuesday and echoing the sentiments of them.",
    "Referring to the claims, Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando said it was unbecoming of the JVP leader to provoke protestors to unleash violence and vandalism against anyone . He said the JVP leaders instigated a similar murderous culture during the 88/89 period .",
