    "People will accept the cabinet if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has an open discussion with political parties representing Parliament and forms it according to a proper agreement, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Rajitha Senaratne said today.",
    "\u201cMr. Wickremesinghe had not invited parties to join the cabinet until now, but has had clandestine discussions individually with MPs.",
    "All will accept the cabinet only if it is formed after a formal open discussion with parties and in accordance with a proper agreement. Mr, Wickremesinghe can have an open dialogue with political parties even now and form a proper government if he has self-respect,\u201d Dr. Senaratne told a media briefing.",
    "\u201cPremier Wickremesinghe breaks up political parties and tries to woo MPs to his side. There are funds ready for this purpose.Those who join the government are doing so either for money or for positions. The government is currently formed in a conspicuous manner.\u00a0 No one in the world would assist the government which is formed in such a manner,\u201d he said.",
    "Responding to reports that former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will be appointed as the Leader of Opposition, Dr. Senaratne said this move is also a part of the conspiracy.",
    "\u201cThe allegation that the SJB Leader was too late to accept the premiership when it was offered to him is incorrect; as the understanding between the UNP Leader and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint the former as the Prime Minister began two week ago,\u201d he also said.
