    "Aquarius leader, bassist Benjy Ranabahu, had plans to take a break, from the music scene, after disbanding the group\u2026last month (March)",

    "However, due to the present situation, Benjy felt that this was not the best time to travel and decided to keep his London trip, on hold, for a future date.",
    "But, since music is his passion, the dynamic bassist decided to get the new-look Aquarius into shape\u2026and he has done it!",
    "With the exception of Benjy, and female vocalist, April Shockman, from the lineup that excited, till the end of March, 2022, the rest are all new faces to the Aquarius scene.",
