    "The former CBSL Governor also speculated that the\u00a0time to have approached IMF was probably December 2020, and to prepare the way for IMF program and at that time, if Sri Lanka went to the IMF at the time, debt restructuring would not have been a pre-condition.",
    "\u201cInterestingly there is some indication that the Japanese Government may also now be forthcoming in terms of providing debt financing,\u201d he added.",
