    "Pledges to #BreakTheBias for a more equitable world on International Women\u2019s Day 22",
    "This International Women\u2019s Day, Unilever set the standards in creating an equitable workplace by recognising menstrual leave as part of its existing sick leave policy and introducing sanitary dispensers at the workplace to break the stigma around women\u2019s menstrual health.",
    "This is a year after the company introduced two industry first policies in Sri Lanka including Unilever\u2019s Fertility Support Policy which offers financial support and medical leave for IVF treatments for couples, as well as its Domestic Violence Support Policy to encourage people enduring domestic abuse to speak up and get psychological counselling, medical advice and legal and financial support, with paid time off.",
    "Adding her thoughts, Unilever Sri Lanka Human Resources Director Ananya Sabharwal said: \u201cIt is easy to sometimes talk about the softer aspects of Equity and Inclusion, but we have been asking the question \u2018How do we really hardwire Equity and Inclusion at our workplace?\u2019.",
    "We have been striving to do this by launching meaningful policies. Other than policies such as Fertility Cover and Domestic Violence Support, we also offer extended Maternity and Paternity Leave, and Career Breaks to enable our people to pursue their personal goals while in employment.",
    "As an inclusive organisation, we ensure that our policies empower both women and men. We truly believe that it is our responsibility to bring both Equality and Equity into this world, because it\u2019s not enough to give a shoe to everyone, it needs to be a shoe that fits each of them.\u201d",
    "Unilever Sri Lanka Chairperson and Managing Director Hajar Alafifi said: \u201cEquity recognises that our individual differences and circumstances mean we aren\u2019t all able to access certain rights and opportunities equally. It may appear that a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach is fair; however, at Unilever, we have changed our perspective to recognise that people have different starting points and challenges.",
    "As such, through our many policies and initiatives, we aim to create an equitable world for all, free from bias, stereotypes and discrimination, where we can truly collaborate beyond all differences.\u201d",
    "Marking International Women\u2019s Day 2022, the company also hosted an awareness building panel discussion for its employees and their families on the biases surrounding women leadership and women\u2019s health, with the participation of Unilever Sri Lanka Chairperson and Managing Director Hajar Alafifi; Unilever Sri Lanka Marketing Director \u2013 Beauty and Personal Care and Head of Corporate Communications Nilushi Jayatileke; Unilever Sri Lanka Head of Medical and Occupational Health Dr. Dinesh Weerasooriya and Ninewells Hospital Senior Medical Officer Dr. Asanka Pathiratne.",
    "Unilever also partnered with Ninewells to offer a special discount to its employees and their family members for women\u2019s health check-ups including pap smears and mammograms.",
    "Throughout the years, Unilever has always strived to promote inclusion and diversity regardless of one\u2019s gender, religion, age and other differentiating factors. The company encourages women in the workplace to step out of their comfort zone, have a voice as to how innovations are shaped, and contribute to real change.",
    "Currently 55% of Unilever\u2019s Management Committee are women, 31% of its workforce are females, its baby cologne manufacturing plant is operated by women, and recently Unilever introduced its first ever female workforce at its Horana manufacturing facility."
