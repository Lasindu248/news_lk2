    "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the committee which he appointed comprising UNPers had become defunct after the appointment of the cabinet.",
    "Responding to SJB MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Premier Wickremesinghe said he appointed the committee comprising of UNPers as there was no cabinet when he took office.",
    "\u201cThere were no Ministers when I took over as the cabinet became defunct after the resignation of the former Premier. There were no secretaries in change of Ministries as well,\u201d Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cI appointed UNP National Organizer Sagala Ratnayake to take charge of energy and he initiated dialogues on purchasing fuel on credit lines. I appointed UNP General Secretary Palitha Range Bandara and Chairman Vajira Abeywardene to be in charge of getting down essential food. UNP Assistant Leader Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was put in charge of fertilizer and UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene was put in charge of health.\u00a0 \u00a0These persons do not function now as the cabinet has been appointed,\u201d the Prime Minister said.",
    "\u201cI never asked for the premiership. Some MPs wanted me to have a dialogue with the President and I heeded their request. The President wanted me to become the Prime Minister during this discussion which I had with him. I wonder whether the SJB MPs say the things they say now about me if Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa becomes the Prime Minister. The Premiership was offered to Mr. Premadasa and also Sarath Fonseka but they declined the offer,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
