    "I would like to add my best wishes on the occasion of this sacred day.",
    "In particular, Poson Poya Day is the day when the Sri Lankan state was blended together with the essence of Dhamma politics as well as the spiritual well-being of the Sri Lankan people.",

    "The advice given by Arahath Mahinda to shape the governance of Sri Lanka by adopting the Chulla Hasthi Padopama Sutta, setting aside differences and ideological inequalities while producing food on local soil, should be taken as our model at this moment.",
    "At the same time, with the Poson Poya Day in mind, we must all unite in determination to transform the State of Sri Lanka back into a calm and prosperous society following the preconceived Dhamma message.",
    "This path is the way to preserve the Poson culture inherited from Arahath Mahinda\u201d."
