    "It is indeed a great privilege and honour to pen this article celebrating the life and service of Ven. Dr. Omalpe Sobitha Thera on this landmark occasion of his 72nd birthday, which also happens to coincide with the Vesak Poya Day this year. I have had the honour of associating with Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thero very closely for the last few years, and he has played an instrumental role in shaping my spiritual knowledge of Buddhist philosophy over time. I offer Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera, my most profound reverence, prayers, and warmest wishes on this occasion.",
    "Omalpe Sobitha Thera was born on May 26, 1950 in the town of Embilipitiya to J. Juvanis Appuhamy and W. K. Podimanike.

Even though, as a standard traditional practice, a bhikkhu\u2019s given name would be preceded by his birthplace,\u00a0 Sobitha Thera, opted otherwise. He chose to be ordained under his father\u2019s village name \u2018Omalpe\u2019, instead of Embilipitiya,\u00a0 as a mark of respect to his parents. He obtained his primary monastic education under the guidance of Ven.
