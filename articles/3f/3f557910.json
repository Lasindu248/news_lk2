    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka lifted a police curfew imposed on multiple police sectors in the Capital City of Colombo at 5 AM on Friday (1)",
    "Authorities were compelled to impose a curfew after ugly scenes were witnessed on Thursday (31) night during protests against a mismanaged economy and rising cost of living.",
    "Scuffles broke out between protestors and security forces on Thursday (31) night when a peaceful protest proceeded towards Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence on the outskirts of the city, in Mirihana.",
    "Heavy police presence was witnessed in the area at first, and thereafter the Riot Police, Police Special Task Force, Sri Lanka Army, and Sri Lanka Navy personnel were called in to control the situation and prevent the protestors from proceeding towards the President\u2019s house.",
    "It is still unclear if the President was at home at the time of the protest.",
    "The people involved in the protest were from all corners of Colombo, and expressed anger over the government\u2019s handling of the economy.",
    "The country has been plagued by a shortage of reserves that led to a shortage of essentials such as Kerosene, Diesel, Petrol, Gas, and even medicines.",
    "While the protest was taking place the supply of electricity for the entire Mirihana area was shut down, the first time since the power cuts came into effect, as Sri Lanka also struggles to import fuel to keep its power plant running.",
    "Further, internet connectivity in some areas also was disrupted, for reasons unknown.",
    "Another protest took place in Kelaniya as the road between Kelaniya and Dalugama was obstructed by protestors who burn tires and chanted slogans for the government to resign over their mishandling of the country\u2019s economy.",
