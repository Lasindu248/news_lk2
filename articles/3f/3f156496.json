    "SriLankan Airlines brought home two prestigious titles from the APEX Passenger Choice Awards, presented in Dublin on 8 June. SriLankan was bestowed the 2022 Passenger Choice Awards for Best Cabin Service for the first time and Best Wi-Fi for the second time in Central/Southern Asia by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX).",
    "One of the world\u2019s largest international airline associations, APEX, partnered once again with TripIt from Concur, the world\u2019s highest-rated travel-organising app, to gather anonymous passenger feedback and ratings on categories such as seat comfort; cabin service; food and beverage; entertainment; and Wi-Fi.",
    "The wins over competing airlines, based on customer ratings exemplify SriLankan\u2019s longstanding commitment towards its vision to be Asia\u2019s most customer-centric airline. The airline draws upon insights from its own passenger survey as well to enhance the quality of the onboard product, introducing incremental changes to the meals; entertainment; inflight connectivity; and overall comfort presented on board on a constant basis.\u00a0 SriLankan Airlines Chief Executive Officer Richard Nuttall stated, \u201cOur efforts have paid off yet again, and it\u2019s wonderful to receive confirmation from our passengers that we are doing things right. SriLankan Airlines has always sought to elevate the customer\u2019s journey, and that is central to the decisions we make and embodied in our employees who go the extra mile to provide a real Sri Lankan welcome to all our guests.\u201d",
    "In 2021, SriLankan Airlines also became the first airline in South Asia to receive the \u2018Diamond\u2019 Standard by APEX Health Safety powered by SimpliFlying, for ensuring the highest standards of cleanliness and sanitisation across its operations."
