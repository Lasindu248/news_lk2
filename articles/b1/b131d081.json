    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has clarified his position regarding the Parliament vote in a series of tweets today (17).",
    "1/ This was not a vote on the Motion of Displeasure against the President. This was a vote to suspend all Parliament proceedings and immediately debate the Motion of Displeasure. #SriLanka",
    "2/ I advised M.P. Sumanthiran on the 16th that this would be self-defeating, as government MPs who were wanting to debate the attacks on their houses would not vote in favour to immediately debate the Motion of Displeasure.#SriLanka",
    "3/ It would have been better to allow the debate on the attacks to take place today, and in a few days time these Government MPs would be compelled to vote in favor of the symbolic Motion of Displeasure.#SriLanka"
