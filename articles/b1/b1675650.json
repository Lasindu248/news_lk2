    "While addressing the media, he said the GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) examination is scheduled to start on May 23. \"The authorities should swing into action to resolve the issues within the next four days, as it would be difficult for the children, also to the principals, teachers, and staff who need to perform their duties at the examination centres,\" he said.
