    "In a video statement issued yesterday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the priority in the distribution of the latest shipment of 3,500 metric tonnes of LP gas would be given to hospitals, hotels and crematoriums.",
    "Unloading of this LP gas shipment began yesterday at the Litro Gas terminal in Muthurajawela, after the payment of USD 2.5 million, which includes the demurrage charges, was settled on Monday.",
    "The LP gas tanker was anchored for over six days off Thaldiyawatta coast in Kerawalapitiya as the balance payment was delayed.",
