    "External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar was apprised of the looming shortage of medical supplies faced by the Foundation during his visit to the Suwa Seriya Headquarters in Colombo in March 2022.",
    "Responding to the urgent requirement, Indian Naval Ship (INS) Gharial was specially deployed for ensuring expeditious delivery of medical supplies to Sri Lanka.\u00a0 In addition to Suwa Seriya Foundation, medical supplies for General Hospital Hambantota, Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya and Teaching Hospital, Jaffna were also carried onboard INS Gharial.",
    "The 1990 emergency ambulance service, spread across all the 25 Districts of Sri Lanka, is a shining example of India\u2019s people-centric and demand-driven development cooperation partnership with Sri Lanka. The ambulance service was realised through a grant assistance of around $ 22 million by Government of India. The service proves to be immense value to the people of Sri Lanka and plays an instrumental role in saving precious lives. Over 25 tons of drugs and medical supplies which were donated by the Government and people of India during the last two months are valued at close to Rs. 370 million. This is in addition to economic assistance of around $ 3.5 billion and supply of other humanitarian supplies such as rice, milk powder, kerosene etc."
