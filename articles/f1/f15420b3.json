  "body_lines": [
    "The delay in bringing the no-confidence motion against the government could be a deal between the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and the government, Former Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara alleged today.",
    "He told a news conference that several weeks have elapsed since the SJB was preparing to hand over the no-confidence motion and they lacked the enthusiasm to do it now.",
    "\"We doubt if the SJB has struck a deal with Basil Rajapaksa. I sense some secrecy behind the delay in moving the no-confidence motion to evict the government and form an all-party government as demanded by the majority of the people,\" he said.",
    "He said the SJB doesn't seem to be having any enthusiasm to form an all-party government and added that SJB leader Sajith Premadasa was speaking against it now.",
    "Mr. Nanayakkara said they were not concerned as to who becomes the Prime Minister in the all-party government but all they want was to evict this government. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
