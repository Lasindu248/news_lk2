Banagala Upatissa Thero focused his attention on the similarity of teaching of Lord Buddha and teaching and practices in the Islamic faith. He stated, \u201cMany people would be shocked to think of Islam and Buddhism being comparable in any way and yet if you look closely at their teachings, and their efforts towards peace, they are more similar than one may suspect.\u201d Further elaborating on the teaching of Lord Buddha, the Most Venerable Thero said, \u201cBuddhist philosophy is really important for world peace. The mantras and philosophy are valid and useful in everyone\u2019s life, not only for Buddhists.\u201d",
