    "The new move comes amid speculations over defections from the ruling party with intensifying protests demanding President Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led government to resign after it\u2019s economic mismanagement resulting in a painful economic crisis and shortage of essentials.",
    "The decision to strengthen and continue Prime Minister Rajapaksa\u2019s leadership also comes after the SLPP\u2019s popularity has nosedived due to its failure to address the economic crisis and debt repayment. Already nearly 40 MPs have defected the party which has lost two-third majority already.",
