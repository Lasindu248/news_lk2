    "CCIY Vice Chairman K. Vignesh highlighted its ongoing member support to understand the customer-centric mindset, stating: \u201cMost businesses spend more time and effort to improve their sales and profits, ignoring their customers and their needs. The past two years have thrown a spotlight on how fragile the business landscape is. However, it also showed how organisations can sustain their businesses if they adopt a customer-centric mindset.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka@100 Senior Advisor Dhanushka Wijeyapala who led the workshop said, \u201cOur training today is based on curated content to share knowledge and industry best practices that can enable these firms to become consumer-centric organisations. This reflects our commitment towards uplifting the growth of the broader SME ecosystem in our country as we embark on the post-COVID road to recovery.\u201d",
