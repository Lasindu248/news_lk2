    "Lack of veterinary medicine for cows, spare parts for chilling centres aggravate situation",
    "The All Island Dairy Association (AIDA) yesterday urged the government to take immediate action to prioritise the importation of quality cattle feed in the backdrop of dwindling milk production in the country.",
    "They point out that proper micro-nutrients and vitamins from quality imported feed is an essential part in their industry as livestock constitutes a key element in the supply chain.",
    "They say that it is imperative that feed such as maize silage is readily available as it would greatly assist in sustaining the industry because feeding cattle with maize silage as a major diet and protein source has a positive impact on the milk yield, milk composition, body weight change and quality of cow milk by-products.",
    "AIDA says that the restrictions placed on imports due to the foreign currency crisis is crippling their industry due to these reasons.",
    "Binesh Pananwala, President of AIDA said,\u201d As an industry with endless potential to help the economy, the dairy industry is one of the most important industries in the country. However, rising costs, scarcity of feed, vitamins, fuel and fertiliser requirements of different fodder crops and the difficulty in importation of maize have greatly put the industry\u2019s survival at risk.\u201d",
    "\u201cLack of quality animal feed has largely disrupted the dairy industry\u2019s supply chain. If the livestock does not receive essential micronutrients and vitamins from maize silage, the physical wellbeing of cows get affected, which thereby affects milk production. Veterinary professionals have also continuously expressed their concern about the shortage of medicines such as antibiotics and anaesthetics required for operations,\u201d he said.",
    "A.C.H Munaweera, Consultant and General Manager of AIDA said, \u201cThe impact of the foreign exchange crisis is felt in multiple aspects of our industry. The industry is already struggling to sustain itself and we are unable to meet the demand for fresh milk and powdered milk. Milk production has reduced by a great deal already and if not rectified, it will spell disaster for the industry in the near future,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe government of Sri Lanka has provided permits for the importation of maize on a case-by-case basis. But fodder importers and dairy companies have been struggling to import these inputs due to lack of foreign exchange and banks find it difficult to honour Letters of Credit (LCs) for importers to send in the raw materials we need,\u201d they said.",
    "Nishantha Jayasooriya, immediate past president of AIDA said, \u201cThe entire industry has felt the tremendous impact of the crisis. The livestock farmers, producers, input suppliers and distributors have all been affected by rising costs and lack of resources. If conscious decisions and changes to fiscal and monitory policy are not made, the industry will suffer even further as it will be unable to meet the demand for both fresh milk and milk powder.\u201d",
    "Gamini Rajapaksha, Treasurer of AIDA said, \u201cProcessing and value additions are integral and vital parts of the dairy industry. Dearth of foreign exchange and consequential scarcity of fuel, electricity etc. have adversely affected the processors. Some of the leading dairies are unable to operate their plants due to lack of power, which forces them to refuse supplies of milk from the farmers. This has directly affected the livelihood of rural dairy farmer. Chilling tanks at milk collection centres cannot be operated, causing large volumes of milk to be discarded. Another aspect is the importation of equipment and spare parts for the dairy processing plants. Many dairy plants will be compelled to stop production altogether unless they are able to import spare parts within the next few weeks. If urgent steps are not taken to remedy the situation, the entire dairy industry will come to a halt.\u201d",
    "CSE urged to look at alternative mechanisms to mitigate impact of forced selling of stocks",
