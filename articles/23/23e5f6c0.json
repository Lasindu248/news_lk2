    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The COVID-19 years saw an increase in Sri Lankans seeking psychotherapy as the pandemic took its toll on the emotional well-being of the community, experts say.",
    "Sri Lankans are going for therapy more than ever after the country underwent several lockdowns since March 2019 which contributed to the uptick in the number of people seeking mental health care and assistance.",
    "Dr N Kumaranayake, a psychologist based in Colombo said: \u201cThe number of psychologists who reported receiving more referrals almost doubled since the start of the pandemic. It was 37 percent in 2020 and this year it is 62 percent.\u201d",
    "Lockdowns and working from home isolated many Sri Lankans from the rest of the community. Even as workplaces began to open up, schools remained closed, with younger children missing out on essential social interaction for almost a year.",
    "\u201cIsolated people combat loneliness and low self-esteem. More people also developed social anxiety during COVID,\u201d said Kumaranyake.",
    "A Sri Lankan working overseas told EconomyNext: \u201cAt home, several issues occurred after lockdowns and COVID. My mother was hardly getting to see me and the rest of the family. This got to her and she had to go in for therapy as she also suffers from dementia.\u201d",
    "Psychologists say that the mental side effects of the initial lockdowns seem to be manifesting only now.",
    "A psychotherapist based in Colombo said: \u201cI\u2019ve found that people are talking more about the effects of the lockdowns on their lives (relationships, work and family) now than at the outset of the pandemic. I think it takes time for the impact to be felt.\u201d",
    "A 1965 research in California found that people with strong social ties who engage in unhealthy behavior such as smoking and gambling had longer life spans than socially isolated people living healthy lifestyles. (However, the researchers did note that\u00a0 people with both healthful lifestyles and close social ties lived the longest of all).",
    "Socialising plays an important part in mental and physical health, both of which are taking hits during the pandemic, experts say.",
    "During lockdowns, it was reported that several organisations in Sri Lanka took measures to combat loneliness felt by those living in apartments by organising concerts where tenants could engage themselves and socialise.",
    "The Department of Demography at the University of Colombo found in 2019 that Sri Lanka had the 20th highest suicide rate in the world, despite a slow but steady decline in the number of cases over the years.",
    "A research in Sri Lanka by Bristol University named farmers, daily wage labourers, women-headed households and foreign migrant households as groups who were most at risk of attempting suicide.",
    "The study also highlighted that economic factors are instrumental in driving suicide rates, as individuals who cannot afford basics like childcare and health facilities are at greater risk of attempting suicide.",
    "Early in March, the privately owned NewsFirst reported the case of a 34-year-old man from Kalutara who died by suicide after being unable to repay a loan of 10,000 rupees despite \u201cworking hard to save the money\u201d. Reports said his four children had been hungry for several days.",
    "As Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis worsens and people queue up for essentials like cooking gas and diesel, the numbers of violent incidents and petty theft have also been on the rise. So far the country has reported four deaths at fuel stations, with one being a murder, where the victim was brutally stabbed following an argument at a fuel line.",
    "Seeking mental guidance in Sri Lanka comes with deeply entrenched social stigma, and according to Colombo-based psychologist Dr Marcel De Roos, many people fear being called \u201ccrazy\u201d for consulting a therapist and having their feelings invalidated.",
    "A 20-year-old from Colombo, who started online therapy sessions during the pandemic said on the condition of anonymity that her parents, though supportive in every way, advised her to \u201cstay quiet about it,\u201d due to societal taboos.",
    "However, as the pandemic marked its second year in Sri Lanka, therapists have seen more people breaking societal norms and stepping in to getting consulted for various issues including suicides, depression and anxiety.",
    "According to\u00a0 De Roos, the attitudes of mainstream healthcare professionals towards people with mental illnesses, and people admitted to hospitals after failed suicide attempts show how ill-equipped Sri Lanka\u2019s medical field is to deal with such cases.",
    "Patients who seek mental health often face stigma even in places they are supposed to get help, according to at least one source.",
    "Experts say that the practice of drugging \u201cmentally unstable\u201d individuals to turn them docile is commonplace, and that many mental health professionals indiscriminately prescribe medications that do not help patients in the long run.",
    "\u201cMore focus has to be put on identifying the root of people\u2019s issues, which comes through listening rather than the prescription of medicine,\u201d said De Roos. (Colombo/Mar28/2022)"
