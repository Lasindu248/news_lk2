    "Youngsters using cannabis mixed aphrodisiacs as an alternative to alcoholic spirits owing to its sky rocketing prices in the present economic crisis is becoming a dangerous trend, was the view of a senior academic of Sri Jayewardenepura University.",
    "Chairman of Mental Health Foundation and Sri Jayawardenepura University Senior Professor Gnanadasa Perera said a trend is developing amongst the youth towards consuming cannabis mixed aphrodisiac called \u2018madana modaka\u2019 by means of a cheaper intoxicant.",
    "The professor says a recent study has proved that the youth, especially senior schoolchildren tend to use this intoxicant as a cheaper alternative to hard liquor like arrack due to the increasing prices of the latter several times in the last few months.",
    "\u201cAbusing madana modaka could seriously affect one\u2019s mental condition as it contains strong intoxicants. Getting addicted to something like that could be recognised as drug abuse and the users have to be rehabilitated in a medical facility,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Prof. Perera, the use and availability of these intoxicants are widely circulated through social media targeting the young generation.",
    "Therefore, the responsible authorities should regulate the use and spread of these madana modaka intoxicants and laws should be implemented. Because of its low prices, it is easily available for the youth, the professor further said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)"
