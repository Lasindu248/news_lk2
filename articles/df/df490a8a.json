    "Team Nana Shilpa, Runners-Up of Imagine Cup 2022 World Championship, at Microsoft Campus Redmond USA",
    "Team Nana Shilpa presents to judges during 2022 Microsoft Imagine Cup World Championship in Seattle on May 24, 2022",
    "Team Nana Shilpa\u2014among top three in world\u2014competed with tens of thousands of teams from over 160 countries at 20th edition of Microsoft Imagine Cup",
    "Microsoft recently announced that Team Nana Shilpa emerged as the Runner-Up following an intense finale against Team V Bionic and Team Melodic at Imagine Cup World Championship 2022, in Seattle, Washington.",
    "The team from Sri Lanka won a cash prize of US $ 10,000 and with this win, Sri Lankan technology got recognised as one of the top three novel solutions at the global competition.",
    "Microsoft Imagine Cup is designed to inspire students to use their imagination and passion for technology to create innovative solutions that tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest social, environmental and health challenges.",
    "\u201cOur Imagine Cup competition is a great example of the possibilities,\u201d said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.",
    "\u201cFor 20 years, students have shown us what\u2019s possible when they come together to apply technology to help solve the world\u2019s challenges.\u201d",
    "Team Nana Shilpa emerged as one of the top three to advance to the World Championship out of the tens of thousands of students from over 160 countries who registered for the 2022 Imagine Cup. Last week, the team had the opportunity to showcase their original tech innovation to judges through a three-minute pitch and a question-and-answer session. The team flew out to Seattle from Colombo for the last leg of the competition.",
    "The team\u2014comprising Kalpani Abeysinghe, Chamil Diluksha, Maheshani Makalanda and Prabath Shalitha from the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) in Malabe, came up with Nana Shilpa, an application that screens and provides guidance for addressing reading, writing and math learning disabilities in the Sinhala language. The team announced that the app would support different languages and cultures in a bid to help young children across the world.",
    "Many children with learning disorders struggle in school long before being diagnosed. A learning disorder is an information-processing problem that prevents a person from learning a skill and using it effectively. As a result, the disorder appears as a gap between expected skills, based on age and intelligence and academic performance.",
    "\u201cWe live in a world where technology can address various problems. Nana Shilpa helps to eliminate the delay in learning disability discovery using localised languages. It captures input from a mobile device and processes it using advanced machine learning and computer vision algorithms. If a child is diagnosed positive for a learning disability, the app then provides curated activities to mitigate the condition,\u201d Kalpani disclosed.",
    "\u201cThe screening AI models are trained using thousands of data points collected from children with learning disabilities,\u201d said Kalpani.",
    "\u201cThe professional screening process to identify learning disabilities can cost between 400 and 2,000 dollars. With Nana Shilpa, we can cut that to just 60 dollars. We are on a mission to help every kid in the world to read and write.\u201d",
    "This year\u2019s championship was won by Team V Bionic from Saudi Arabia and Germany. The team developed a modular exoskeletal hand rehabilitation device called ExoHeal that utilises neuroplasticity and Azure technology to provide adaptive and gamified rehabilitation exercises to people with hand paralysis.",
    "\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Imagine Cup competition not only challenges students to utilise technology creatively to make a difference in the world but also provides the opportunity to connect, engage and learn from a community of like-minded young innovators,\u201d said Microsoft Sri Lanka and the Maldives Country Manager Harsha Randeny.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see students from Sri Lanka showcase their unique solutions that have the potential to create lasting impact. Congratulations, Nana Shilpa.\u201d"
