    "UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that a letter had been received on Wednesday from the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu addressed to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, requesting the use of \u201cT\u00fcrkiye\u201d instead of \u201cTurkey\u201d for all affairs.",
    "The spokesman said the country name change became effective from the moment the letter was received.",
    "Cavusoglu announced the letter\u2019s official submission to the UN and other international organisations on Tuesday.",
    "\u201cTogether with our Directorate of Communications, we have been successful in preparing a good ground for this,\u201d said the letter.",
    "\u201cWe have made it possible for the UN and other international organisations, countries to see this change to using \u2018T\u00fcrkiye\u2019,\u201d Cavusoglu told Anadolu Agency.",
    "Turkey began the move to change its internationally recognised official name in English to T\u00fcrkiye in December after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan released a memorandum and asked the public to use T\u00fcrkiye to describe the country in every language.",
    "\u201cT\u00fcrkiye is accepted as an umbrella brand for our country in national and international venues,\u201d Erdogan said at the time. \u201cT\u00fcrkiye is the best representation and expression of the Turkish people\u2019s culture, civilization and values.\u201d",
    "Erdogan also advised companies to use \u201cmade in T\u00fcrkiye\u201d for their exported goods, and instructed state agencies to use T\u00fcrkiye in their correspondence."
