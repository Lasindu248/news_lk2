    "REUTERS: U.S. investment bank JPMorgan backed Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis-hit government bonds yesterday, saying recent political changes in the country should gradually improve its strains and help its talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Adding an \u2018overweight\u2019 - effectively a buy recommendation - JPMorgan analysts said that \u201cpolitical stability should pave the way for bonds to move higher from near all-time lows\u201d.",
    "Sri Lanka is officially now in default as a so-called \u201cgrace period\u201d to make some already-overdue bond interest payments expired yesterday.",
    "\u201cWe think this stability should result in both the IMF discussions and the process of appointing legal and financial advisors moving forward,\u201d JPMorgan added."
