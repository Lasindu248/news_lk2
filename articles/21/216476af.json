    "CEAT Kelani Holdings has resumed its Schools Road Safety programme \u2013 the Company\u2019s flagship community initiative in Sri Lanka \u2013 this year with the distribution of road safety equipment to 25 schools in several districts of the country.",
    "The manufacturer of products that are closely linked to road safety, CEAT Sri Lanka presented 175 road safety signboards and 200 traffic cones to schools located in congested areas and main cities such as Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy and Chilaw under this programme which is executed under the \u2018CEAT Cares\u2019 portfolio of community initiatives.",
    "Commenting on the resumption of the Schools Road Safety programme, CEAT Kelani Managing Director Ravi Dadlani said: \u201cMost schools have reopened after the shutdowns necessitated by the pandemic, and traffic on the roads is back to pre-pandemic levels. The resumption of our programme is therefore timely. By equipping schools in busy localities with the necessary equipment, we hope to not only contribute towards the safety of students, parents and staff but to help remind the public about the need to adhere to road rules and drive safely.\u201d",
