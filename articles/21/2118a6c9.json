  "body_lines": [
    "With the recent price hike of the 12.5 kg Litro gas cylinder, the All Island Canteen Owners' Association (AICOA) is in dilemma whether to increase the prices or to maintain prices at the own discretion of the bakers to cover their expenses.",
    "The association's head, Asela Sampath, told the Daily Mirror that the canteen industry in the country has gone to a situation and the redemption is long way off.",
    "\"The hike in the price of gas has impacted heavily on the people's ability to get their food. \"People have to think many times\u00a0 before buying their food. Therefore, we should look for alternatives, \"he said.",
    "\"With the current situation in the country, the gas in a canteen has become the most essential item. If we increase the prices, it will affect all canteen food items, from plain tea, basic snacks to lunch packets, \"Sampath said.",
    "Therefore, he requested the government to cut down on the allowances and salaries of the people appointed by the government, including the gas industry chairman and its director board, by 75%.",
    "They should contribute when the companies are running at a loss. We will organise a massive protest soon against people who are getting higher salaries and allowances who were appointed by the government, Sampath added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
