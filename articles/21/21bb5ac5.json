    "John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) signed an agreement with Hemas Consumer Brands on 9th March 2022 to offer all female employees of the John Keells Group with the \u2018Fems Aya\u2019 sanitary napkins, free of charge, going forward. Menstrual Health is a highly stigmatised topic, and the lack of education on menstrual health and limited access to essential sanitation, may have a negative impact on not only the physical and mental wellbeing\u00a0of individuals but also the productivity of females in the workforce. This facility is launched in line with the Group\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) initiatives, under the brand \u2018ONE JKH\u2019. The partnership also provides a series of awareness sessions on menstrual health by Hemas with the aim of reducing health risks and anxiety related to menstruation.",
    "Krishan Balendra \u2013 Chairman, John Keells Group said \u201cAs part of our ONE JKH initiative, this SanNap programme, is aimed not only to advocate the prioritisation and de-stigmatisation of menstrual health, but also to recognise that it is a basic necessity for all females, including our workforce. \u00a0While providing sanitary napkins free of charge for all female employees, is the first phase of the SanNap programme, the second phase will include extending the facility to all employees who wish to offer their allotment to a female family member, thereby further increasing awareness and supporting the extended John Keells family.\u201d",
    "Speaking on the occasion Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne Managing Director \u2013 Hemas Consumer Brands said \u201cA year ago Hemas Consumer through Fems Aya launched a Multi-Partner initiative for the first time in Sri Lanka and set out to train and educate women across Sri Lanka on menstrual health and hygiene and give access to an affordable Sanitary Napkin.
