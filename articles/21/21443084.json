    "It said: The Reckitt team started 2022 on a momentous note with its brands, Dettol and Strepsils, being recognised by the marketing fraternity, at the SLIM Effie Awards 2021 and the SLIM Digis 2.1. The awards lauded work done by Reckitt in the previous two years, to effectively communicate with its consumers and make a difference in their lives. Dettol was also ranked as the \u2018Most Loved Brand\u2019 in Sri Lanka by LMD Magazine.",
    "Head of Marketing, Reckitt Sri Lanka, Shaminda Perera said: \u201cOver the years, we have offered a range of trusted solutions that have positively contributed to the lives of Sri Lankans around the island. From Dettol to Harpic to Lysol to Durex to Strepsils to Enfa, our brands have helped people live cleaner, healthier lives \u2013 and our role as a consumer healthcare solutions provider has been even more vital in the last two years with the pandemic. Being recognised by the fraternity validates our approach to marketing, and it\u2019s something we continuously evolve to meet consumer needs.\u201d",
    "Marketing Manager, Reckitt Sri Lanka, Chathurika Fonseka said: \u201cConsumer wellbeing is at the heart of everything we do as a brand, and consumer education is a cornerstone of our marketing approach. When the pandemic began, the need for solutions that safeguarded health grew immensely, as did the challenges of getting products to consumers and educating them on ways to stay safe and healthy. It was a national crisis and as a leading healthcare brand, we knew we had to step up our efforts and find new solutions to meaningfully reach people across the country.",
