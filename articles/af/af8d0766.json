    "\u201cWe have a stake in Sri Lanka, we have spent billions on the country\u2019s good will through our service projects,\u201d shared K.R. Ravindran, former President of Rotary International. He shared these thoughts at the press conference held on May 8 at Radisson Hotel. The press conference was held prior to the walk towards Galle Face conducted by Rotary District 3220. Rotarians, Rotaractors and Interactors participated in the walk which started off at Marine Drive, opposite Kollupitiya Railway Station and concluded at Galle Face.",
    "The Rotarians at the press conference demanded transparency and accountability from the state, private and public sectors. Ravindran shared that laws have to be brought in where anyone engaged in corruption whether be it citizens, parliamentarians or corporates would be sentenced to life and their assets confiscated. He also stated that the Rotarians want good governance in the country. \u201cWe are looking for a governance where the government is dishing out truth, a governance which is fair to all concerned, a governance which will bring in goodwill amongst communities, a governance which is ethical and beneficial to all.\u201d",
    "Responding to queries that Rotary is an apolitical organization and that the Rotarians walking in solidarity could be seen as going against the principles of Rotary, N.R. Gajendran, Chairman- College of Governors mentioned that the philosophy of Rotary is peace, goodwill and world understanding. \u201cCan you have peace if you don\u2019t have food? Can you have peace if you don\u2019t have medicine? Can you have peace if you don\u2019t have diesel and petrol to travel? This country is our home, this is our life and livelihood. We are standing up for the humanitarian aspect of the crisis. This is not politics. We are standing up for our rights and showing solidarity,\u201d he explained. Dr Rohantha Athukorala, District Advisor- Public Image, emphasized that poverty levels would rise due to the current crisis. He mentioned that recent research shows that 5.8 million people in Sri Lanka are almost close to poverty levels. \u201cThese are humanitarian crises that Rotary can stand up for.\u201d",
    "Rotary District 3220 held a press conference on May 8, outlining their plans to help the country through the crisis",
    "Pubudu de Zoysa, District Governor-Elect 2022/2023, stated that Rotary was helping out the communities at the community level through Rotary clubs across the island. \u201cWe have also been able to procure the necessary medicines needed through our international Rotary network. We get the priority list of medicines from the government and we are able to procure them through the Rotary clubs overseas. After we receive them, we hand it over to the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, and they distribute it to hospitals across the island as necessary,\u201d she revealed, regarding how Rotary was helping the country get through the medical crisis. Dr. Athukorala also shared that Rotary was planning to give jobs to 2,000 recent graduates and also bring in 500 scholarships from overseas worth Rs 2 billion. \u201cWe are working closely with the government on programmes to facilitate the development of soft skills in the youth so that we can prevent brain drain,\u201d he said.",
    "Rotaract, the youth wing of Rotary, consists of 9,000 Rotaractors across the island. Talking about the contribution of Rotaract to the country, Akila Wijetunga, the District Rotaract Representative stated that Rotaract always takes an effort to better the lives of others and give hope to them. \u201cBut at this point, we are losing hope for our own futures. This is the time for us to stand up and raise our voices seeking justice for our futures. This is why we thought we would join this walk for solidarity with Rotary.\u201d",
    "The Press Conference was also graced by the presence of Aruni Malalasekera (District Governor 2021/2022), S. Karunakaran (Past District Governor)and Ajith Weerasinghe (Chairman- Rotary Solidarity Walk)."
