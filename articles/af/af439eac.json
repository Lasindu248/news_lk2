    "While expressing that there was a visible issue in fuel distribution over safety concerns, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera today requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeygunawardane to intervene to provide security to bowsers and tanker wagons that are transporting fuel.",
    "He told Parliament that there were sufficient stocks of fuel in the country but there is an issue in connection with distributing fuel.",
    "\"We won't be able to distribute fuel today, tomorrow and the day after due to safety concerns. Only 46 bowsers were present at the CPC terminals today,\" he said, and requested the general public to help ensure uninterrupted island-wide fuel distribution.",
    "The Minister said they have sought police and army security to the bowsers and trains transporting fuel.",
    "Responding to a claim made by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that there was no sufficient fuel in the country, he said it was a baseless allegation and said that there is sufficient stocks of fuel in the country.",
    "\"A vessel carrying fuel reached the shores yesterday and it is being unloaded. Another is set to arrive today. We have petrol sufficient for next ten days and Diesel for the next 14 days. We have paid for the two coal shipments and started\u00a0 unloading them today\" he said."
