    "Attempts made by the Sri Lanka Petroleum Private Tanker Owners' Association (SLPPTOA)\u00a0 to reach the fuel transport formula revision has failed to fetch fruitful results, the\u00a0 SLPPTOA has opted to refrain from distributing fuel from midnight today.",
    "The Association's Secretary Shantha Silva told the Daily Mirror that they had requested the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Managing Director that they needed to revise the fuel transport formula within two days considering the recent fuel price hike or else they would refrain from continuing their services.",
    "The association requested that the transport formula be revised to account for the 60% increase in transportation costs by the CYPETCO fuel price increase.",
    "Accordingly, around 800 bowsers engaged in fuel distribution will be suspended from tonight. According to him, the CYPETCO only has 70 to 80 bowsers in operation.",
    "The sudden increase in fuel by CYPETCO, the prices of lubricants, tyres, tubes, batteries, vehicle service charges, vehicle spare parts, and employee salaries have all shot up. Silva said 90% of the members have decided to disengage from the fuel distribution network.",
    "He lamented that the bowsers were unable to get diesel for fuel distribution.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
