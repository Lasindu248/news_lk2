    "Two protesters today filed a Fundamental Rights petition in Supreme Court seeking an interim order against police to remove all police vehicles parked on the pavement along the protesting site declared as the \"MainaGoGama\" outside Temple Trees.",
    "The petitioners Shanika Silva and Eranga Gunasekera stated that on or around 26th of April 2022, the protesters set up their second main protest site in front of Temple Trees, the official residence of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. The protesters renamed the site as MainaGoGama.",
    "They alleged that the police lined a number of buses and trucks purposely on the pavement along the Temple Trees preventing the protesters from continuing their campaign.",
    "They further alleged that parking vehicles on the pavement is clearly prohibited in the law.",
    "The petitioners further said unethical decision of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his officers to play Pirith chanting to oppress the voice of the protesters is an insult to Buddhists.",
    "They further alleged that despite numerous requests by the protesters to remove the vehicles parked on the payment and to remove the loud speakers, the police has not taken any steps to act upon that. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
