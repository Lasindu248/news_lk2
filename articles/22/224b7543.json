    "A part of the money has shifted to food imports and other imports while some are going for urea, sources familiar with the matter has said.",
    "Sri Lanka has since imposed controls on open account imports, which can further push up prices of foods, by delaying food imports.",
    "Meanwhile the government also hike import duties, which can encourage smuggling and undervaluation.",
