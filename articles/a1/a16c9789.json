  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st);\u00a0Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunneththi says that in assessing the damage to the property of the politicians whose property was damaged in recent justice, the assets and liabilities statements given by them previously should be taken into consideration.",
    "Addressing a public meeting in Weligama yesterday (28), the JVP member alleged that many MPs, even after the public burnt their houses in anger of not providing solutions for the current crisis, still continue to serve their own demands by seeking hotels to stay overnight and new houses instead of focusing on the people\u2019s plight.",
    "Therefore, he pointed out that if MPs whose properties and businesses were damaged hands over reports of the damage, they should have previously declared those assets to the Parliament."
