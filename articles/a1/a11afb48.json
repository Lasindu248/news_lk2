    "ECONMYNEXT \u2013 China is \u201csad\u201d that Sri Lanka went to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and defaulted on the its debt, Ambassador Qi Zhenhong said, adding that China is watching the island nation\u2019s negotiations with the Washington-based lender.",
    "\u201cChina has done its best to help Sri Lanka not to default but sadly they went to the IMF and decided to default,\u201d Ambassador Qi told reporters at a media briefing in Colombo.",
    "\u201cThe debt restructuring definitely will have an impact on future bilateral loans,\u201d he said.",
    "Ambassador Qi said in March that China was considering a request for 1.5 billion US dollars in buyer\u2019s credit and another billion dollar loan.",
    "The IMF determined that Sri Lanka\u2019s debt was not sustainable or could not be repaid with macro-economic adjustments involving rate and tax hike alone and had to restructure debt to reduce the gross finance need to a manageable level.",
    "On April 12, Sri Lanka said it was suspending payment on foreign debt and will negotiate with creditors.",
    "Now China was waiting for IMF talks to progress and wanted more information on debt re-structuring. Sri Lanka will negotiate with the Paris Club of western donors, other lenders like China and India, multilaterals and separately with bondholders.",
    "\u201cWe are closely monitoring the IMF discussion between Sri Lanka and IMF,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cCountries that colonised Sri Lanka have more obligations to help at this juncture.\u201d",
    "However China will continue to disburse old loans as agreed, he said. (Colombo/Apr25/2022)"
