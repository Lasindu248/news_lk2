    "Health Minister Channa Jayasumana issuing a gazette notification announced the new prices for 60 commonly used drugs following an acute shortage for drugs. For details: Maximum retail prices of medicines",
    "The government is unable to import drugs as it has run out of dollars in its reserves while private sector firms have said they are unable to bring the drugs into the country as they are deprived of opening letter of credit amid dollar shortage in private banks.",
    "The 84.5 billion economy has already suspended paying 51 billion US dollar foreign debts from April 12 after it had no reserves.",
