  "body_lines": [
    "The Power and Energy Minister today sent a request to potential service and product suppliers to meet the requirements of the\u00a0 Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and extended his gratitude the suppliers to quote the best possible price to the Ministry or for the CPC to evaluate them.",
    "He also said the suppliers who have the capacity to submit their proposals in due course, are assured that the Ministry will analyse and finalise the process in 48 hours.",
    "\"The CPC placed an advertisement three weeks ago inviting bidders who could supply petroleum products to submit proposals.",
    "67 such proposals have been received and all were evaluated by the technical committee. 39 out if them were shortlisted and the potential bidders were contacted last Tuesday,\" the Minister said.",
    "\"We clearly communicated with them about our tentative payment plans, our requirements and responded to all questions they asked.\"",
    "\"Further on that, the President, Prime Minister and I, made requests from petroleum exporting countries for their support and credit lines,\" he said.",
    "Accordingly, 95 petrol and Super Diesel daily requirements are lesser than 10% of the market share. We have explored the idea of increasing the prices of the premium products. Increasing prices significantly on both will not be a solution. In that case, it will create an artificial demand for inferior products. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
