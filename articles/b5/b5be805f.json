    "Hayleys, one of the most diversified conglomerates in the country, did extremely well for the financial year ended March 2021 and for the nine months ended December 2021 as its subsidiaries generated elevated performances, particularly those that generated export earnings, resulting in higher dividend incomes to the holding company.",
