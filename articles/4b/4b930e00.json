    "A verbal confrontation flared up earlier when SJB MP Wijesiri charged that 15 STF men had been deployed to safeguard Mr. Kuttuarachchi\u2019s residence.",
    "Mr. Kuttuarachchi who responded said even Mr. Wijeseiri had been provided with the same kind of security. Mr. Wijeseiri then confronted Mr. Kuttiarachchi calling him \u2018Wambotu\" MP for which the latter lost his cool. Both MPs lost their cool at the end. This became a physical confrontation when Mr. Wijesiri threw a sanitizer bottle at Mr. Kuttiarachchi. The bottle landed on the desk where former Minister Pavithra Wannniarachchi was sitting.",
    "The Speaker announced his decision to suspend the sittings and request the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms to remove the two MPs. He again suspended the sittings till it was done. The sitting resumed around five minutes later. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
