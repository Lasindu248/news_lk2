    "The Hotels\u2019 Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) yesterday said the new \u201cburning\u201d issue for the industry is the inability to offer guests what is listed in the beverage menu due to the shortage of imported liquor.",
    "On March 9, the government imposed restrictions on 369 items via an extra ordinary gazette, which included liquor. The restriction was relaxed earlier this week, however an impact in the coming months is unavoidable.",
    "\u201cWe are unable to offer our guests the services that we promote. The import restriction made it difficult to source key ingredients and items, liquor was one of them,\u201d The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President M. Shanthikumar told Mirror Business.",

    "The decision would result in a substantial hike in the prices of alcoholic beverages offered on the menus of tourist and hospitality establishments.",
    "\u201cIt (surcharge) is definitely high. We were not expecting this. We will be very expensive compared to our regional peers in terms of our alcohol prices.",
    "However, we understand the forex situation of the\u00a0 country. We are looking to make a representation to the Tourism Ministry to see if we can have some concession in this regard to the tourism sector,\u201d he said.",
    "According to the Imported Alcohol Beverages Association (IABA), 80 percent of all imported alcoholic beverages are consumed at SLTDA-approved licensed locations, wine stores located at the vicinity of hotels, and restaurants. The tourism industry gains nearly US$ 20 million from liquor sales per annum."
