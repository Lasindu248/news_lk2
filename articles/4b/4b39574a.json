    "There is no point in substituting and targeting an individual without properly understanding the problems that prevail in the country, head of Presidential Task-force for One Country-One Law and Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera said.",
    "Addressing the media today, he said nearly US$ 15 billion received by the country through the tourism industry, had been lost subsequent to the Easter Sunday attack in the country an during the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "The collapse of the tourism industry directly affected the country's economy, and the dollar reserves in the country were drained for the purpose of importing COVID-19 vaccines and other essentials.",
    "\"But we can see most of the people blaming the government, have not read the true story behind the country's current crisis. As a result, the current issue has expanded, and it has come to a very complex situation. Certain groups claim that the country's economy crash landed because of one person. Some other groups said the current precarious economic situation could be resurrected after chasing the said person off.",
    "If the prevailing issue is not related to a certain individual, it is absurd attacking him. A mandate was given by 6.9 million people to form this government with a two-thirds majority. When the time came to vote for the two-thirds majority, no one vowed to criticize it by dividing it into groups. Everyone voted to stand as one and to rebuild the country, the prelate further asserted. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
