    "ECONOMYNEXT  \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index recovered in May from the April holiday month, while services continued fall with wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, hotels declining, the central bank said.",
    "The manufacturing PMI improved to above 50.3 from 36.4 with employment recovering and also an increase in supplier\u2019s delivery time.",
    "\u201cEven though the lengthening of Suppliers\u2019 Delivery Time generally reflects the expansion in the manufacturing activities, in this instance it was primarily due to supply side impediments arising from clearance delays of imported goods and fuel shortage,\u201d the central bank which compiles the index said.",
    "\u201cMoreover, Employment edged up during the month, particularly in the manufacture of textiles & apparel sector, partly due to cross-industry employee movements.\u201d",
    "The Services PMI fell for the second month to 42.4 in May from 43.8 in April.",
    "\u201cNew Businesses declined further in May 2022 compared to April 2022, particularly with the decreases observed in accommodation, food and beverage, wholesale and retail trade, real estate, and education sub-sectors,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cDecline observed in Business Activities in May was mainly due to supply-side constraints including prolonged power outages and energy shortage.",
    "\u201cIn addition, subdued demand attributable to rising prices and uncertainties in the country also contributed to the decline in business activities.",
    "\u201cMeanwhile, the civil unrest occurred at the beginning of the month also had a negative effect on the business activities.",
    "\u201cAccordingly, wholesale and retail trade, other personal activities and transportation sub-sectors recorded major declines during the month. In addition, business activities of accommodation, food and beverage sub-sector was also affected by the continued drop in tourist arrivals .\u201d (Colombo/June16/2022)"
