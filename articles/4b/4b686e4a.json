    "The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) in a statement yesterday said it was very seriously concerned about the continuing violence and the deteriorating security situation in the country.",
    "\u201cWe fear that the problems may worsen as security forces have been given permission to shoot those who engage in violence against their opponents and those who damage public or private property,\u201d said the SLMA statement issued by President Prof. (Dr.) Samath D. Dharmaratne and Secretary Prof. Ishan De Zoysa.",
    "We urge the security forces to exercise maximum restraint when trying to control unruly elements or mobs and to use only non-lethal measures. We also categorically urge the people to stop using violence against individuals or property.",
    "The electronic and print media have a crucial role to play in this critical period.\u00a0 It should not glorify violence and should avoid heightening anxieties and hatred by showing an excess of violent scenes, under any circumstances. These scenes are watched by children who could be scarred for life. We respectfully request both mainstream and social media to show restraint when airing violent scenes.",
    "We earnestly request all religious leaders and civil organisations to immediately call for peace while reiterating the urgent need to bring all the perpetrators of the recent crimes to justice."
