    "Manil Jayasinghe \u2013 Country Manager, Ernst & Young, and Hiranthi Fonseka \u2013 Partner- Financial Accounting and Advisory Services of Ernst & Young together with Manjula Sirimane \u2013 Partner D.L.F De Saram, and Kareena Teh \u2013 Partner | Solicitor Advocate LC lawyers LLP (Hong Kong Law Firm member of the Global EY network) will host the webinar \u201cAre you ready for the Personal Data Protection Act?\u201d to deliberate how companies can make the fundamental changes proposed by the Act. The session will discuss the salient features of the Bill, the regulatory expectations, and what it means for businesses on a local and international scale.",
    "Speaking on the PDP Act, Manil Jayesinghe comments that Personal Data Privacy should not be looked at in isolation, or as the sole responsibility of Information Officers. He reiterates that this is an organization wide project, involving operations, IT, legal and business processes. As the volume of personal data collected increases, so does the responsibility of protecting it. This responsibility becomes a legal obligation once the PDP Act is passed.",
    "Hiranthi Fonseka adds that the Bill is a much welcome regulation to Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy, allowing the country to be placed alongside countries following GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for example. Drawing in from her experience in digital transformation, Hiranthi emphasizes the need for early adoption of compliance measures, that will require a multi-disciplinary transformational approach. She notes that while the Act may seem prohibitive in that it forces companies to reassess and realign the way in which it collects, processes, and uses personal data, it is in essence an opportunity for companies to strengthen their risk and governance framework, overall Data Privacy and cyber-security.",
    "Published on 25 November 2021, the Sri Lanka Personal Data Protection Bill explicitly defines \u2018Personal Data\u2019 with identifiers such as genetics, mental, cultural, economic, social identity as well as criminal proceedings, children, and biometrics being covered. Once enacted the bill gives certain rights to data subjects and makes clear the responsibilities of the data controllers and processes, while also vesting power in a Data Protection Authority to oversee compliance issues, among other tasks. The Act goes on to stipulate the appointment and role of the Data Protection officer in companies processing high volumes of personal data, and mandates Data flow mapping and Data Protection Impact Assessments, while listing the penalties enforceable for non-compliance.",
