    "The Teachers and Principals Joint Trade Union Alliance has decided to apply for medical leave tomorrow to show their opposition to the government, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that the strike action would be taken in all schools around the country. Even though the strikes have been conducted around the country, the government is not in a position to step down. The government appointed minsters, but not with the thought of providing anything for the people, he said.",
    "\"With the price increase of all essential items and fuel prices, the school system has become a victim. Children are unable to come to school because of the higher transportation costs and school van fee hike. This increased transportation cost has a significant impact on teachers. Considering all these facts, the CTU requested the Education Ministry to give a chance to get a nearby school except for the travel distance. However, the Ministry has rejected the request, \"he said.",
    "Several teachers and principals have decided to come to the Galle Face Green to show their opposition, he said.",
    "Stalin added that the government should take full responsibility for the losses caused to the schoolchildren with their planned action tomorrow. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
