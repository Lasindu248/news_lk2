    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 If Sri Lanka Police fails to find those responsible for the recent attack on journalist Chamuditha Samarawickrama\u2019s residence, as media minister he would not hesitate to accept the government\u2019s responsibility and take any decision necessary, co-cabinet spokesman Dullas Alahapperuma said.",
    "Speaking at the weekly cabinet press briefing on Tuesday (15), Alahapperuma said a recent statement by him condemning the attack was still valid. On March 08, he made a similar statement that failure on the part of the police to find the culprits would inevitably result in the blame falling on the government.",
    "\u201cThe government will be unable to absolve itself of that responsibility. I am still of that position,\u201d the media minister said.",
    "\u201cYesterday marked a month since the attack. I spoke to the police. They said investigations are still ongoing but they have yet to arrive at a conclusion. The file has not yet been closed, they told me. As I said last week, if this is not resolved, the responsibility will inevitably fall on us.\u201d",
    "The government would have to bear the shame of it if the police was\u00a0 unable to find those responsible, said Alahapperuma.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the criminal is a politician clad in white, or an underworld figure dressed in black or a contractor in some other colour.",
    "\u201cWe urge the police, as media minister, to continue investigations. If that cannot be done, I will not hesitate to say that it\u2019s our responsibility. And I won\u2019t hesitate to take any decision regarding that,\u201d he added.",
    "In the early hours of February 14, a gang of unidentified men invaded the gated community Samarawickrama lives in and allegedly threw bags of faeces at his residence. The journalist told EconomyNext that day that he also heard the sound of a gunshot.",
    "Samarawickrama, considered a firebrand media personality with a large online following on top of a TV career going back over two decades, said he had no guesses as to who might have been behind the attack.",
    "The government was quick to condemn the attack. The next day, Minister Alahapperuma said it unequivocally rejected the attack with unreserved disgust.",
    "\u201cThe police is investigating the incident, and we urge the media to expose the attacker, this faeces lover,\u201d said Alahapperuma said on February 15.",
    "\u201cIt is clear that this faces lover is someone with no voice for democracy and is hiding in a lavatory.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is the stink of a festering group of society that is emanating from this attack,\u201d the minister said.",
    "Samarawickrama has been courting controversy with a series of explosive interviews published on his YouTube channel \u2018Truth with Chamuditha\u2019.",
    "His latest videos include one with the leader of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya, who had levelled allegations against controversial Buddhist monk Galabadaththe Gnanasara thero. The monk now heads a task force appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa named \u2018One Country, One Law\u2019.",
    "Another video interview with Chandimal Jayasinghe, the Sri Lankan franchise holder for the Mrs World pageant, had racked up over 350,000 views. In the video, Jayasinghe had made some remarks about Pushpika de Silva, who recently lost her Mrs Sri Lanka for Mrs World title, the culmination of a widely publicised scandal that erupted last year when her crown was forcibly taken off at the 2021 Mrs Sri Lanka pageant.
