    "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday demanded immediate action from the Government to protect the fundamental rights of citizens.",
    "In a statement the Chamber said it was alarmed by the violent attacks on protestors outside Temple Trees and at Galle Face and called upon the Government and the armed forces to take immediate action to prevent peaceful demonstrators being attacked.",
    "\u201cAn impartial investigation should be carried out to identify those responsible and hold them accountable. Failure to take immediate action to protect the fundamental rights of citizens will result in grave repercussions on the maintenance of law and order and disrupt the ongoing initiatives to resolve the serious economic and political crises faced by the country,\u201d the Ceylon Chamber said."
