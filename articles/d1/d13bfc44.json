  "body_lines": [
    "The gazette notification declaring maximum price for local varieties of rice, had set prices higher than the prevailing market prices, National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP) President Ranjith Withanage said.",
    "It is known that a gazette notification for selling one kilo of white or red Nadu (steamed or boiled), white or red Samba (Steamed/ Boiled) was issued yesterday by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA).",
    "Furthermore, he said the gazette notification sets control prices only for local rice whereas imported rice varieties are widely sold in the market.",
    "Also, there is no control price for the raw rice that consumers buy in reasonable quantity, he claimed.",
    "The NMCRP has requested the subject Minister to stop issuing gazette notifications just for the purpose of pleasing rice mill owners, but to protect local consumers and to be mindful of the prices at which rice is being sold in the market before issuing such meaningless gazette notifications. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
