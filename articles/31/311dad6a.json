    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Fort Police on Monday (18) informed the Colombo Magistrate\u2019s Court that it would inform the court if the peace is disrupted during protests at Galle Face demanding the resignation of the President and the government.",
    "The submission was made in a report to Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunuwela by Sri Lanka Police.",
    "The Fort Police has informed court that the large crowds gathering at Galle Face has affected the movement of vehicles along that road.",
    "However, Att.-at-Law Gunarathne Wanninayake commenting to the media noted that these are attempts being made to remove protesters from Galle Face area by obtaining a court order.",
    "\u201cThe legal fraternity is vigilant about the witch hunt that is being carried out against these protesters. They haven\u2019t made submissions to court through a B report. If submissions are not made through a B report then it means to crime has not taken place. So there is no crime,\u201d he said.",
    "He said the protesters should not be afraid of anything as there is a massive group of lawyers who are with them.",
    "\u201cIf the government forcefully attempts to disperse them even by court order, there is no doubt that it will go down as a tragedy. If the magistrate asks for a B report, we as lawyers will be ready to oppose it. That is the message for those involved in the struggle at the protest site,\u201d he added.",
