    "Amazing Thailand has been rated as the fourth most attractive travel destination in the world, post-pandemic, with Bangkok, Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Hua Hin being the top Thai cities global travellers look up online. And, I\u2019ve been to all these exciting destinations, courtesy of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, and the Royal Thai Embassy, in Sri Lanka",
    "The study, according to Visa Global Travel Intentions Study 2021, was carried out during January-October 2021, with analysed data from over 7,000 keywords searched by travellers from 62 countries, as well as Thailand\u2019s travel information, to five Thai tourist cities and travellers\u2019 sentiments regarding the pandemic\u2019s impact on travel situation.",
    "The study indicated the top three motivations for global travellers, intending to visit Thailand, are leisure pursuits (30%), the chance to escape and relax (25%), and outdoor adventure (18%). This demonstrates visitors are looking for stress-free holidays that provide optimum opportunities to relax, get outdoors, and leave the worries of the pandemic behind.",
    "The study also revealed that, when in Thailand, tourists are most likely to head for activities and attractions that have made Thailand famous. The top activity preferences are going for a famous Thai massage, eating Thai food at cafes and restaurants, spending time at their resort, and embracing Thai culture; such as, visiting a Buddhist temple.",
    "According to te Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), Thailand\u2019s tourism industry is showing signs of recovery, with increasing visitor numbers, over the next three years, expected to reach around 46.96 million\u2026by the end of 2024. The ongoing relaxation of tourist entry requirements, throughout the year, should make it easier for tourists to return to Thailand.",
    "In the meanwhile, Thailand\u2019s Centre of COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) has approved the simplified Thailand Pass registration and entry rules for international arrivals, which came into effect 1st June, 2022.",
    "Foreign nationals are still required to apply for a Thailand Pass (via https://tp.consular.go.th/), but will only need to provide passport details, vaccination, and an US$10,000 health insurance policy.",
    "The system will then automatically issue a Thailand Pass QR code for the applicants. Thais, however, will no longer be required to apply for a Thailand Pass.",
    "Upon arriving in Thailand, vaccinated travellers must undergo entry screening, and will then be allowed entry and are free to go anywhere in the kingdom.",
    "Unvaccinated/not fully vaccinated travellers, who are able to upload proof of a negative RT-PCR, or professional ATK test, within 72 hours of travel, via the Thailand Pass system, will also be allowed entry and are free to go anywhere in the kingdom.",
    "The CCSA also approved further easing of nationwide COVID-19 controls with three colour-coded zones: The Pilot Tourist Areas or blue zones, the Surveillance or green zone, and the Areas under Stringent Surveillance or yellow zone.",
    "Night-time entertainment venues; such as, pubs, bars and karaoke lounges, in the green and blue zones, will be allowed to resume operation, including the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverage, on the premises, till 12.00 midnight. However, all venues have been requested to strictly adhere to the prevention guidelines.",
    "The CCSA also lifted the quarantine requirement for the high-risk contact.",
