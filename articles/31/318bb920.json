    "In a letter to Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Dr. Prasantha Jayamanna, the Ceylon Shipping Agents Association (CASA) has commended the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and other terminal operators for their prompt responses to the normalisation of operations and services at the Port of Colombo.",
    "\u201cCASA would like to appreciate the immediate steps taken by the SLPA Chairman, Harbour Master, all SLPA officials, private terminals - SAGT and CICT \u2013 CEOs to stabilise work with support and cooperation of Port Trade Union leaders who clearly work together to restore normalcy in operations avoiding any ill effects of a prolonged work stoppage,\u201d the letter states. Despite the baseless allegations levelled by certain media outlets over the operations in the Port of Colombo, the letter reaffirmed the normalcy of the port by emphasising that \u201cat present, we note that all vessels are being berthed and sailed as before and inter-terminal transhipment connections are being made and no missed connections are experienced.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe would also like to reassure Shipping Lines through our Member Shipping Agents of the fast return to normalcy and assure them of the productivity and turnaround that they are accustomed to in Colombo Port,\u201d the letter assured.",
    "\u201cSince the resumption, all the container berths have been full and as they completed succeeding vessels took their positions. Navigational movements were carried out even during the adverse weather which prevailed to catch up with the lost time,\u201d the letter further observed whilst assuring the CASA\u2019s full support to the Port of Colombo in maintaining its critical role as a regional transhipment hub."
