  "body_lines": [
    "Despite having recommenced liquefied petroleum (LP) gas distribution from today, Litro Gas officials are warning that the state institution remains at risk of closure from a staggering Rs.2,000 loss on each cylinder.",
    "Addressing a media briefing today, Litro officials explained that the sudden devaluation of the Rupee has further complicated its purchases at current market rates.",
    "They explained that if this continues, the company has only three months left to survive without a price hike.",
    "On Wednesday, Litro Gas halted LP gas distribution, citing a lack of adequate stock for domestic consumption.",
    "The decision was taken following the inability of the gas distributors in the country to secure the necessary foreign exchange to clear the LP gas shipments anchored in Sri Lankan waters.",
    "However, yesterday\u2019s state-owned distributor Litro Gas announced that it was finally able to secure US dollars to pay for and clear one shipment with the unloading process having commenced as of last evening.",
    "As a result, cylinder distributing resumed this morning, with Litro saying that 120,000 cylinders were to be released to the market today.",
    "However, with only one LP gas tanker having being unloaded, the question of how long the stocks would last before another shortage looms remains.",
    "So far, thousands of restaurants and bakeries have been forces to shut down with no gas to fire up their ovens."
