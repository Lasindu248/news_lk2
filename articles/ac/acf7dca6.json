    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has re-appointed three secretaries to ministries who lost their jobs when Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned.",
    "Sri Lanka ended permanent secretaries, abolishing a civil service commission, the bulwark of the country\u2019s public service through the 1971 and 1979 constitutions.",
    "It led to to a gradual destruction of the independence and capacity of the public service according to critics.",
    "The legal provisions to destroy the public service were written by the country\u2019s legal and constitutional \u2018experts\u2019, critics say, with Presidents transferring and demoting secretaries who give good advice or refuse to carry out wrong orders after 1979.",
    "President Gotabaya Rajapksa has re-appointed retired Retired General Kamal Gunaratne to the defence ministry, retired Major General Jagath Alwis to the Ministry of Public Security and Mahinda Siriwardana to the Finance Ministry.",
    "Though a 19th amendment to the constitution sought to give tenure security to lower level officials through a constitutional council and independent commissions the apex of the public sector was left exposed.  (Colombo/May10/2022)"
