    "\u201cIt is learnt that the missile landed in an area of Pakistan. While the incident is deeply regrettable, it is also a matter of relief that there has been no loss of life due to the accident.\u201d",
    "The ministry said the government had \u201ctaken a serious view and ordered a high-level Court of Enquiry\u201d.",

    "\u201cThe admission that it was a missile was very nonchalant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does this say about their safety mechanisms and the technical prowess of very dangerous weapons? The international community needs to have a very close look at this.\u201d",
    "The official said it was possibly a BrahMos missile \u2013 a nuclear-capable, land-attack cruise missile jointly developed by Russia and India.",
