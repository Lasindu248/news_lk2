During the period under review, the interest income has increased by 7.3% to reach Rs. 131.4Bn, while the interest expense has decreased by 12.3% to Rs. 76.8Bn due to the prevailing lower interest rate regime which leads to lower interest expenses for the deposits as well as borrowings despite the substantial growth in the deposit base during the period considered. The increase in interest income together with the considerable reduction in interest expenses supported Net Interest Income (NII) to surge by 56.6% to Rs. 54.6Bn against Rs. 34.9Bn stood during the same period last year.
