    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s transport ministry has temporarily blocked a proposed train fare hike after media reports emerged of a sudden increase effective midnight Thursday (24), Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "Amunugama told reporters Thursday evening that the Sri Lanka Railway Department had announced the proposed fares to the media before they were approved by the ministry. Therefore the price revision was not valid, he said, noting that a final decision would be taken next week.",
    "\u201cThe railway department had made some reforms to the prices of special and intercity train ticket,\u201d Amunugama said.",
    "\u201cBut I stopped it from being implemented because it has been released to the media before presenting them to the ministry for approval. That is wrong. We were about to have this meeting on Friday (25) and the final decision will be announced next week on Monday or Tuesday.\u201d",
    "The ministry does intend to increase the fare in order to cover the increased fuel cost, he added.",
    "The general public in Sri Lanka is currently facing price increases of all commodities following a rupee depreciation amid a forex shortage.",
    "All FMCG products prices increased overnight after the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) increased fuel prices last week. (Colombo/Mar25/2022)"
