    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The\u00a0Bar Association of Sri Lanka proposes to nominate a suitable candidate for the post of Prime Minister of a Government formed by the consensus of all parties from Parliament or from the National List.",
    "The President of the Bar Association Saliya Peiris PC, speaking on the program \u2018Pathikada\u2019 today (26), stated that in the face of the current crisis, all parties must join forces and appoint an MP who can unite the entire Parliament instead of an MP who holds the most amount of trust in the Parliament.",
    "If not possible, the MPs should be able to look beyond the Parliament and appoint a person as the Prime Minister, even if the person came from the National List.",
    "Clarifying further, the BASL President stated that under the normal circumstances, the majority vote of 113 would have been necessary to appoint a Prime Minister, however, considering the extenuating circumstances as the political and economic turmoil are intertwined, it is necessary to bring upon a unifying leader.",
