  "body_lines": [
    "The Teachers and Principals' Joint Trade Union Alliance has decided to apply for sick leave tomorrow to show their dissent to the government, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that they will be engaging in strike in all schools across the country.",
    "Even the strike cripples the whole country, the government will not step down. It used to appoint ministers, but does not have any plan to provide the relief to the suffering masses.",
    "\"With the prices of essentials, fuel and several others are skyrocketing, the schools are made to suffer. Children are unable to attend schools due to higher transportation costs and the school vans too have increased their fees beyond the parents' affordability. These have made a significant impact on the teachers too. Considering all these facts, the CTU requested the Education Ministry to give a chance to the children to get into a nearby school, which will help travelling cost and duration. However, the Ministry has rejected the request, \"he said.",
    "Several teachers and principals have decided to come to the Galle Face Green to show their dissension, he said.",
    "Stalin added that the government should take the whole responsibility for the losses caused to the schoolchildren with their planned action tomorrow. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
