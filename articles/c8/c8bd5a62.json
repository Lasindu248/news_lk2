  "body_lines": [
    "As a result of the decision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to allow flexibility in the exchange rate,\u00a0the exchange rate seems to have now reached a level surpassing the level of incentives that was\u00a0intended to stimulate expatriate workers\u2019 remittances and conversion of export earnings, a statement issued by the Central Bank said.",
    "Accordingly, the current exchange rate provides a higher return on the foreign exchange\u00a0remittances of expatriate workers and a higher rupee value on the net earnings of exporters, the Central Bank said.",
    "\u201cIn\u00a0view of these recent developments, the government has decided not to implement the proposed\u00a0scheme for additional incentives for remittances by expatriate workers and net earnings of\u00a0exporters.\u201d",
    "With the notable upward adjustment in the exchange rate, the conversion of foreign exchange\u00a0earnings through formal channels by expatriate workers and exporters have already shown a\u00a0marked increase during March 2022, according to the latest official data of the Bank.",
