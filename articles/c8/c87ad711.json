    "\"Today, we summoned the SriLankan Airlines Board to the Parliamentary committee. They admitted they did not know the Sri Lanka's Economic Crisis was this grave when the decision was made and agreed to suspend the entire process. As a start, all timelines would be extended by three months.",
    "It is inconceivable that SriLankan Airlines Board was that clueless about the SriLanka economy given stature of members and all top professionals. However said there was no Treasury Representative (thus didn\u2019t know the real gravity), I am going to let this one go since they admitted the error,\" he tweeted.",
