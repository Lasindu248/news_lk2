    "Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC said yesterday it has recorded a steady growth in Revenue and Profitability, primarily driven by the Havelock City Residential sales, to record a Group Revenue of Rs. 7,051 million and a Group Profit Before Tax of Rs. 2,936 for the first quarter ended 31 March 2022.",
    "The company revenue of Rs. 527 at the World Trade Centre, Colombo was 3% higher than the corresponding period of last year, due mainly to higher rental rates. Revenue of Rs. 6,427 million was recorded by 31 March 2022 from apartment sales of Havelock City, compared to Rs. 761 million in the previous period, due mainly to higher apartment sales.",
    "\u201cThe strong growth in Revenue and Profitability was fronted by the robust performance of Havelock City Residential apartment sales during the first quarter of 2022.\u00a0 Weakening Sri Lankan rupee and an increase in inflation in the past few months, resulted in a strong demand for residential properties,\u201d stated Overseas Realty (Ceylon) Group Director/CEO Pravir Samarasinghe.",
    "\u201cAmidst the many difficulties including the economic crisis and import restrictions and with support extended to the contractor, 94% of the works of the Mireka Tower and Shopping Mall at Havelock City were completed by the end of March 2022. However, the acute shortage of foreign exchange in the country, and the consequential inability to repay foreign currency borrowings and the resultant forex exposure is a concern,\u201d added Samarasinghe.",
