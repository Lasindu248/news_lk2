    "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says that two new private international companies have been selected to supply petrol and diesel to Sri Lanka while another private company has been selected to supply jet fuel (aviation fuel).",
    "The minister made this observation during a press conference held today (16) at the ministry premises to brief the media on the present fuel situation in the country.",
    "He stated that four suppliers have been given permission to import crude oil based on the proposals put forward by them and that two suppliers have been given permission for the import of petrol and diesel required for the coming week.",
    "The minister said that whenever any supplier presents a proposal it is studied and permission granted by the cabinet sub-committee comprised of officials if it is a new supplier.",
    "Accordingly, for now four suppliers have been given the relevant documents to import crude oil to bring in the first shipment as an experiment, he said.",
    "He said two other companies have been given permission for petrol and diesel imports under three orders.",
    "Wijesekera further said that only a limited number of people can be supplied with fuel from a load of a fuel bowser.",
    "He said a fuel load is 6,600 liters and that within the previously announced fuel release limit, one load can only supply 220 vehicles with fuel, however there are around 2,000 vehicles in queues at some fuel stations.",
    "\u201cPlease be aware of that. Fuel bowsers cannot be sent repeatedly to one gas station.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo we can send a load back to that gas station on the next scheduled date,\u201d he said."
