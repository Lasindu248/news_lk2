    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Twitter has confirmed that it is working on an edit button that would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted.",
    "It comes after a new board member, Tesla boss Elon Musk, asked his followers in a Twitter poll whether they wanted the feature.",
    "Many users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns about how to execute it.",
    "Twitter said it would start testing the idea in the coming months.",
    "The social media firm\u2019s communications team tweeted, \u201cNow that everyone is asking. yes, we\u2019ve been working on an edit feature since last year,\u201d.",

    "Jay Sullivan, the company\u2019s vice president of consumer product, said it had been \u201cthe most requested Twitter feature for many years\u201d in a thread on Tuesday.",
    "However, he said the company was exploring how to build the feature \u201csafely\u201d.",
    "\u201cWithout things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cProtecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.\u201d",
    "During a talk in 2018, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said the firm would \u201cprobably never\u201d add the feature amid concerns about transparency.",
