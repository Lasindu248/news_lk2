    "(Reuters) - Australia\u2019s Labor Party was set to end almost a decade of conservative rule as the government was swept away in Saturday\u2019s election by a wave of support for candidates who campaigned for more action on climate change and may hold the balance of power.",
    "Partial results showed that while Labor had made small gains, Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s Liberal-National coalition had been punished by voters in Western Australia and affluent urban seats in particular.",
    "The Greens and a group of so-called \u201cteal independents\u201d, who campaigned on policies of gender equality and tackling climate change, put on a strong showing, tapping voter anger over inaction on the environment after some of the worst floods and fires to hit Australia.",
    "\u201cTonight, I have spoken to the leader of the opposition and the incoming prime minister, Anthony Albanese. And I\u2019ve congratulated him on his election victory this evening,\u201d said Morrison.",
    "Albanese, speaking as he headed to his party celebrations, said he wanted to unite the country and \u201cend the climate wars\u201d.",
    "\u201cI think people want to come together, look for our common interest, look towards that sense of common purpose. I think people have had enough of division, what they want is to come together as a nation and I intend to lead that.\u201d",
    "Albanese said he aimed to be sworn in swiftly so he could attend a meeting of the Quad security grouping in Tokyo on Tuesday. He promised constitutional recognition and parliamentary representation for Indigenous Aboriginals, as well as the establishment of an anti-corruption commission.",
    "In results so far, Labor had yet to reach the 76 of the 151 lower house seats required to form a government alone. Final results could take time as counting of a record number of postal votes is completed.",
    "With 60% of the vote counted, Labor had 72 seats and Morrison\u2019s coalition 55. Independents and the Greens held 11, the Australian Broadcasting Corp projected. A further 13 seats remained in doubt.",
    "The centre-left Labor had held a decent lead in opinion polls before the election, although surveys showed the Liberal-National government narrowing the gap in the final stretch of a six-week campaign.",
    "In one of the biggest hits to the government, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for him to hold the long-held Liberal seat of Kooyong in Melbourne against an independent newcomer.",
    "Three volunteers working for teal independent Monique Ryan, who was challenging Frydenberg, said they joined Ryan\u2019s campaign because they were concerned about the climate for the sake of their children and grandchildren.",
    "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like this election actually feels hopeful,\u201d Charlotte Forwood, with three adult children, told Reuters.",
    "With Morrison stepping down as party leader and Frydenberg likely to lose his seat, Defence Minister Peter Dutton - a former policeman from Queensland - was shaping up as favourite to lead the Liberals.",
    "Early returns suggested the Greens had made ground, looking to pick up to three seats in Queensland.",
    "Greens leader Adam Bandt, who retained his inner city Melbourne seat, said climate was a major issue for voters.",
    "\u201cThere was an attempt from Labor and Liberal to bury it, and we were very clear about the need to tackle climate by tackling coal and gas.\u201d",
    "Morrison and Albanese earlier cast their votes in Sydney after making whistle-stop tours across marginal seats in the final two days of a campaign dominated by rising living costs, climate change and integrity.",
    "As Labor focused on spiking inflation and sluggish wage growth, Morrison, a strong supporter of Australia\u2019s coal industry, made the country\u2019s lowest unemployment in almost half a century the centrepiece of his campaign\u2019s final hours.",
    "\u201cOur countries have a long history and a bright future together. As thriving, like-minded democracies we work every day to make the world a better, safer, greener and more prosperous place.\u201d"
