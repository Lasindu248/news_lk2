  "body_lines": [
    "Chairperson of Sri Lanka Tourism, Kimarli Fernando tendered her resignation to Tourism Minister Harin Fernando today, claiming that she could not meet the Minister to review progress and discuss matters related to the Tourism Industry.",
    "Fernando, in the letter claimed it was regrettable and unprofessional that she could not\u00a0meet the Minister to review progress, to guide on the best practices adopted, as the Minister intended to appoint a new Chairman and Board of Directors.",
    "\u201cTwo meetings that you fixed for 21 and 23 May were cancelled. Especially at this critical time for the nation, when tourism would provide the fastest hard currency benefits, the cavalier attitude you have displayed does not bode well. I hope I am proved wrong,\u201d Fernando claimed in her resignation letter."
