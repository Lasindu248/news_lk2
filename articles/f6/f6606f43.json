    "The decision on fuel subsidy or a bus fare revision will be announced on Tuesday (15) morning after the cabinet decision, Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "He stated that the sudden hike in diesel prices has made a direct impact on the country's transport sector.",
    "\"During COVID pandemic, we gave them a 17% bus fare hike. They continued their service with a profit. This will not be an issue if the price of diesel is increased by Rs. 25, but increase of more than Rs.50 creates an issue, \"the Minister said.",
    "\"Several rounds of discussion will take place with the Finance Minister today and tomorrow whether to grant a fuel subsidy or a price revision. The discussions with private bus owners' associations will be held tomorrow,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, the private bus owners' associations were informed to continue with their service until the ministry would inform them about the price revision, he said.",
    "Even if they do not continue, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses have been assigned to stand in without causing any inconvenience to the public, Minister Amunugama said.",
    "However, there will be no revision on train ticket fare, he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
