    "As the cost of food soars around the world, the United Nations warns that the war in Ukraine risks aggravating inflating prices and causing a full-on global food crisis.",
    "The UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s (FAO) food price index, a tool to measure prices of the most globally traded food staples, dipped in May for the second consecutive month after reaching a record in March, the UN agency said on Friday.",
    "Despite the decline, the May index showed prices 22.8 percent higher compared with a year earlier, pushed higher by concerns over the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 one of the world\u2019s major bread baskets.",
    "Luca Russo, the FAO\u2019s lead analyst for food crises, told Al Jazeera that as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sends energy prices higher, the cost of delivering aid has increased as well. The risk of a severe food crisis is particularly felt in the developing world, he warned."
