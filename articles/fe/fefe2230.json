    "Leadership is a concept spoken about a great deal these days, but what does leadership mean? Does leadership mean being in a position of authority? Or is there more to it than simple designations?",
    "Leadership is a trait that can be expressed by anyone at any level, be it at school, your workplace, or even at home. Leadership simply means taking charge of your situation and working towards your goals in a timely and effective manner. This will demonstrate to those around you that you are capable and proactive in your work, which will instinctively make people trust you and your abilities. In an organization, identifying your stakeholders, understanding the culture and building a great company philosophy is vital.",
    "Leadership is one of the pillars of development and good leaders can help empower those around them to grow exponentially. Leadership is also necessary to identify problem areas and find solutions for these issues. One such issue facing the modern world is the climate crisis. Many global leaders have discussed sustainability and the importance of undertaking sustainable practices in business and other aspects of life. These sustainable practices can range from simple things such as switching to bio-degradable items such as paper straws and minimizing the use of plastic bottles to programs taking place on a macro-economic to promote sustainability.",
    "These are the issues that \u2018Ceylon Institute Of English & Leadership (CIOEL)\u2019 wishes to address through its \u2018Leadership and Sustainability Programme\u2019. Both of these aspects are very important in the modern world and if mastered, can help the individual grow tremendously.",
