    "CA: Australia\u2019s first tour of Sri Lanka in six years is set to proceed as planned while some players have expressed concern about the impact of travelling to a country in the midst of an economic crisis and political unrest.",
    "Some players were said to have \u201ca level of discomfort\u201d about touring while Sri Lankans face significant fuel shortages, rolling power cuts, a desperate shortage of medicine and supplies and ballooning inflation.",
    "But there is no suggestion any player will opt out of the tour, with the squad scheduled to fly out next week for the three-format tour that begins with T20 matches from June 7.",
    "It will be Australia\u2019s first visit to the island nation since 2016.",
    "The Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association CEO Todd Greenberg said some players had raised questions about the moral and ethical implications of the tour given the situation in Sri Lanka, but would tour.",
    "\u201cThe players are very aware of the situation in Sri Lanka and it\u2019s fair to say there is a level of discomfort around touring in conditions that contrast those faced by the people of Sri Lanka, such as rising food prices, power cuts and fuel rationing,\u201d Greenberg told AAP.",
    "\u201cUltimately our players want to continue to play cricket and will take direction, guidance and advice from CA about tour arrangements and planning.\u201d",
    "Having recommitted to it a fortnight ago when protests first turned violent, despite Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) saying Australians should \u201creconsider\u201d their need to travel to the country, CA has received further assurances that the tour was safe to go ahead.",
    "A reconnaissance of the country by the governing body\u2019s own head of security in April also gave the go ahead.",
    "And there is a belief that by touring, Australia could help Sri Lanka\u2019s economy with an expectation they would drive big crowds in the matches in Colombo, Pallekele and Galle.",
    "Players are also buoyed by the fact Australia\u2019s first tour to Pakistan in 24 years went off without any security dramas earlier this year, despite continued unrest in nearby areas.",
