    "Although gender equality and women empowerment are not novel concepts in the modern world, as there have been many changes occurring in the thinking patterns of the minds of people, achieving gender equality is an important part of the Sustainable Development Goals of Sri Lanka. Females play a significant role in the global economy, as they invest more on the socioeconomic life of their families more than males do.",
    "Female participation to the economy is considered a vital factor for a middle income country like Sri Lanka to be at the forefront of the next wave of economic growth. Currently, female participation in the labor force is at 40% which is significantly lower than 75% of men\u2019s contribution. It is a known fact that, female entrepreneurs will reinvest in their business, families and education, assisting a sustainable economic growth. Therefore, empowering women is the key to achieve more entrepreneurs in the country and thereby increasing the contribution to the country\u2019s economy.",
    "The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka established a special setting for women entrepreneurs \u201cNCE Women\u2019s Wing\u201d who are already involved in exports to encourage and motivate them with a long term vision to achieve sustainable economic growth and the achievement of development goals through active participation of women in business.

    "To find out opportunities available in foreign markets for women exporter or entrepreneur.",
    "Contribute towards the government\u2019s initiative to increase the women participation in business and legislative framework.",
    "In line with the stated objectives, NCE has already initiated connecting local banks with multi-national companies for export related projects such as loan schemes for small and medium enterprises owned by females, whilst seeking foreign funding for projects related to women empowerment in international trade.

We are also representing issues faced by women owned enterprises at various forums related to international trade.",
    "In furtherance, in its business plans for the next year, the NCE is also planning to conduct training programs, seminars and webinars and also identify regional talents of women entrepreneurs for entry into international trade through links with regional chambers. Moreover, we will also create networking opportunities with other women led enterprises both local and international.",
    "In highlighting and recognizing the performance of Sri Lankan women led businesses in the international markets, the NCE confers a special award for \u201cBest Woman Exporter of the Year at the Annual Export Awards, the flagship event of the Chamber.
