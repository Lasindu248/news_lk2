    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Power cuts of up to 8.5 hours in some areas in Sri Lanka have been approved for Saturday (02), Public Utilities Commission said as severe foreign exchange shortages to import fuel and power deficits in the dry season had led to long blackouts.",
    "Areas A, B, C, D, E, F, P, Q, R, and S will see four hours of power outages from 8am to 12pm, three hours from 4pm to 7pm and 1.5 hours from 9pm to 10.30pm.",
    "Areas G, H, I, J, K, L, T, U, V, and W will experience four-hour power cuts from 12pm to 4pm, three hours from 6pm to 9pm and 1.5 hours from 10.30pm to 12am.",
    "Areas M, N, O, X, Y, and Z, however, will lose power only for 3.5 hours from 5.30am to 9am .",
    "Though the government has said the duration of the power cuts will be reduced gradually, it has been extended mainly due to lack of fuel amid severe shortage of US dollars for imports.",
    "The lack of fuel has also resulted in long queues for diesel and petrol despite record price hikes. (Colombo/April 1/2022)"
