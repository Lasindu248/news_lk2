Achieving a minimum of 150 active minutes a week can help them live longer, sleep better and boost their mood.",
    "The Chief Bancassurance Officer of Union Assurance, Vindya Cooray said, \u201cBeing a responsible insurer is much more than a tagline. Tackling obesity is one of the greatest long-term health challenges in Sri Lanka. According to the WHO, more than a quarter of Sri Lankans are overweight, and NCDs such heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease cause over 80% of deaths in the country.
