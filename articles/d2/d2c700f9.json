    "Expressing grave concern on the statement issued by the President\u2019s office saying 'Extremist Group\u2019 was responsible for the protests in Mirihana, the Church of Ceylon today questioned the motive in rushing to identify parties alleged to be responsible within such a short period of time without stating any credible basis for such conclusion.",
    "The Church of Ceylon said in a statement that the President and the Government must listen to the cries of the people of this country and fulfill their fundamental obligations as a responsible administration.",
    "\"The state is duty bound to lay out its short, medium- and long-term plans for economic recovery as a matter of urgency. The government has to devise a mechanism for immediate infusion of foreign currency to the economy in order to avert a Human catastrophe of an unprecedented magnitude,\" the statement added."
