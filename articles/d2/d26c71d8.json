    "The buses that were provided to support the struggle by our association on May 9 were burnt as if they were destroyed during the height terrorist activities.",
    "Therefore, the police should take action to arrest those involved the incidents, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.",
    "He told media that some 45 private buses were completely gutted during the carnage.",
    "\"This was a willful attack launched by a section of the public. They have attacked and torched down private and Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses involved in transporting passengers and the commuters in those buses too came under assault, he said.",
    "Therefore, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) should swing into action to arrest those who involved. If not, there would be an uncertainty in conducting public transportation in the future, Wijerathne said.",
    "Most of the parts from the destroyed buses were removed by looters in Maharagama, he said. He requested the IGP to provide security to the buses that were damaged during the unrest. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
