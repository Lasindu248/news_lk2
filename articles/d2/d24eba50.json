    "COLOMBO; Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars gala and other Academy events for 10 years after the US actor slapped comic Chris Rock at the Oscars.",
    "In a statement, the Academy said the 94th Oscars had been \u201covershadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Smith exhibit on stage\u201d.",
    "Smith has apologized for his actions and resigned from the Academy.",
    "The actor hit Rock for joking about his wife\u2019s shaved head, a result of the hair-loss condition alopecia.",
    "Less than an hour later, he was awarded the best actor award for his role in \u201cKing Richard\u201d, where he played the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams.",
    "The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts and Science, which organizes the awards ceremony, met virtually on Friday to discuss disciplinary action.",
    "In its statement, it said banning Smith was aimed at protecting performers and guests and \u201crestoring trust in the Academy\u201d.",
    "The Academy said that at the time of the slap it did not \u201cadequately address the situation in the room\u201d and had been \u201cunprepared for the unprecedented\u201d. I apologized for this.",
    "It also thanked Rock for \u201cmaintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances\u201d.",
    "In his resignation statement, Smith said he had \u201cbetrayed the trust of the Academy\u201d and was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over his actions.",
    "He added he would \u201cfully accept any consequences for my conduct\u201d.",
    "His resignation means he will be unable to vote for future Oscars voters.",
    "The Academy\u2019s disciplinary review over the incident, originally scheduled for 18 April, was fast-tracked after Smith resigned.",
    "Few have ever resigned from the academy. Four members \u2013 producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Bill Cosby, director Roman Polanski, and cinematographer Adam Kimmel \u2013 have been booted over sexual misconduct allegations, while actor Carmine Caridi was expelled in 2004 for pirating screener videos given to him.",
    "But the standards of conduct laid out by the film academy contained various disciplinary options for Smith, such as excluding him from future Oscars ceremonies, revoking his eligibility for awards, or taking back his newly won Oscar.",
    "Only one Oscar has ever been taken back; a feature called \u201cYoung Americans\u201d won the best documentary honor in 1969 but was found to be ineligible for the award that year.",
    "Late last month, actor Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 a member of the academy\u2019s board of governors \u2013 predicted Smith would face \u201cbig consequences\u201d but said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to take that Oscar away from him.\u201d",
    "Beyond the Academy\u2019s actions, at least two studios \u2013 Sony and Netflix \u2013 are pausing their projects with Smith.",
    "Rock, who began his latest stand-up comedy tour shortly after the Oscars telecast, has not commented publicly on the slap.",
    "He told fans at a show last month that he is \u201cstill kind of processing what happened\u201d and will talk about the incident \u201cat some point\u201d.",
