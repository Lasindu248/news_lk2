    "Even certain groups from the neighboring countries have begun intervening in the affairs of Sri Lanka today, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said over the weekend.",
    "\" A curse is upon Sri Lanka as a result of action taken by certain groups who had set people against each other to come into power, Some politicians used the Easter Sunday attacks to come into power. They failed to implement most of the recommendations made by the Presidential commission which proved the attacks on April 2019. They are hiding those who were really behind the Easter Sunday attacks. Therefore a curse is upon Sri Lanka,\" the Cardinal Ranjith said.",
    "\" We even see efforts made by certain groups in neighbouring countries to intervene in Sri Lanka' s affairs. However it is possible to pull this nation from the present crisis ,\" he added. (Yohan Perera)"
