    "The Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA Sri Lanka) yesterday condemned the Rambukkana incident and calls for a full, transparent investigation and immediate intervention of the law enforcement agencies to bring perpetrators before justice. With deep concern, we urge that the Government intervenes in upholding rights conferred on its citizens through provisions enshrined in the constitution in respect of freedom of expression through peaceful dissent."
