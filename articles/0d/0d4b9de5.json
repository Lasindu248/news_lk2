  "title": "Marked stress on Asia in US foreign policy",
  "body_lines": [
    "US President Joe Biden\u2019s recent tour of some Asian powers is indicative of a renewed and enhanced interest the US is beginning to take in the Indo-Pacific region. In this his first Asian tour the President chose to visit Japan and South Korea besides helming a Quad meeting in Tokyo and there is good reason for the choice of these venues and engagements.",
    "The first phase of these bridge-strengthening efforts by the US began in late August last year when US Vice President Kamala Harris visited South-east Asia in the wake of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Besides being driven by strong economic compulsions, the US intention was also to ensure that too much of a power vacuum did not open up in the region, following its pull-out from Afghanistan, since China\u2019s perceived expansionist designs are a prime foreign policy concern of the US.",
    "However, the US President\u2019s recent wide-ranging tour of East Asia seems to have been also prompted by some currently intensifying trends and tensions in the wider stage of international politics though the seeming power vacuum just referred to has a significant bearing on it. The immediate purpose of the US President\u2019s tour seems to have been to bolster his country\u2019s backing for Japan and South Korea, two of the US\u2019 closest allies in East Asia. This is necessitated by the \u2018China threat\u2019, which, if neglected, could render the US allies vulnerable to China\u2019s military attacks on the one hand and blunt US power and influence in the region on the other.",
    "While Taiwan\u2019s airspace has reportedly been frequently violated by China, sections in Japan have reasons to be wary of perceived Chinese expansionist moves in Japan\u2019s adjacent seas. Moreover, many of China\u2019s neighbours have been having territorial disputes with China, which have tended to intensify the perception over the decades that in the Asian theatre in particular China is a number one \u2018bogey\u2019. For historical reasons, South Korea too has been finding the increasing rise of China as a major world power considerably discomforting.",
    "Accordingly, the US considers it opportune to reassure South-east Asia in general and its allies in the region in particular of its continuous military, economic and political support. Though these are among the more immediate reasons for Biden\u2019s tour of the region, there are also the convulsions triggered in international politics by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to consider.",
    "Whereas sections of international opinion have been complacent in the belief that military invasions of one country by another are things of the distant past, the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine in February this year proved them shockingly wrong. We have the proof here that not all authoritarian rulers are prepared to adhere to the international rule book and for some of China\u2019s neighbours the possibility is great of their being attacked or invaded by China over the numerous rankling problems that have separated them from their economic super power neighbour over the decades. After all, China is yet to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and is increasingly proving an \u2018all weather friend\u2019 of Russia. Right now, they are the strongest of allies.",
    "The \u2018China threat\u2019 then is prime among the reasons for the US President\u2019s visit to East Asia, though economic considerations play a substantive role in these fence-strengthening initiatives as well. While South-east Asia is the \u2018economic power house\u2019 of the world, and the US would need to be doubly mindful of this fact, it would need to reassure its allies in the region of its military and defense assistance at a time of need. This too is of paramount importance.",
    "President Biden did just that while in Tokyo a couple of days back. For instance, he said that the US is \u2018fully committed to Japan\u2019s defense\u2019. Biden went on to say that the \u2018US is willing to use force to defend Taiwan.\u2019 The latter comment was prompted by the perceived increasing Chinese violations of Taiwan\u2019s air space. After all, considering that Russia has invaded Ukraine with impunity, there is apparently nothing that could prevent China from invading Taiwan and annexing it. Such are the possible repercussions of the Russian invasion.",
    "Meanwhile, North Korea is reportedly carrying on with its development of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. On this issue too, South Korea would need to have US assurances that the latter would come to its defense in case of a North Korean military strike. The US President\u2019s visit to South Korea was aimed at reassuring the latter of the former\u2019s support.",
    "However, as mentioned, economic considerations too figured prominently in the US President\u2019s South-east Asian tour. While being cognizant of the region\u2019s security sensitivities, bolstering economic cooperation with the latter too was a foremost priority for the Biden administration. For example, the US is in the process of formalizing what has come to be referred to as the Indo-Pacific Trade Treaty. The US has reportedly already inducted Japan and South Korea as founding members of the Treaty while, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand are mentioned as prospective members to the treaty.",
    "The perceived threat posed to Western interests in South-east Asia by China needs to be factored in while trying to unravel the reasons for this region-wide endeavour in economic cooperation. It needs to be considered a Western response to China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative which is seen as having a wide appeal for the global South in particular.",
    "While the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having a divisive political and economic impact on the world, international politics will increasingly revolve around the US-China stand-off on a multiplicity of fronts in time to come. Both sides are likely to try out both soft and hard power to an exceptional degree to exercise foremost influence and power in the world. As is already happening, this would trigger increasing international tensions.",
    "There was a distinct and sharp note of firmness in the voice of the US President when he pledged defense and military support for his allies in Asia this week. Considering the very high stakes for the US in a prospering South-east Asia, the US\u2019 competitors would be naive to dismiss his pronouncements as placatory rhetoric meant for believing allies.",
