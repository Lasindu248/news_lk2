    "When Chandrika Kumaranatunga took office she pledged to introduce a new Constitution that would repeal what she described in colourful Sinhala as Bahubootha\u00a0Executive\u00a0Presidential form of governance. This task was entrusted not to a Constituent\u00a0Assembly of Parliament but to a group of individuals with a range of expertise, with leadership from, Prof GL Pieris, Minister of Constitutional Affairs and late Dr Neelan Tiruchelvam. Both were distinguished\u00a0alumni of the Peradeniya and Colombo Law Faculty of that time. They had both competed for the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. Late Lalith Athulathmudali said that the decision to award the scholarship to GL was based on a careful scrutiny of my husband\u2019s letters of reference to each at some point in their\u00a0careers. My husband was famous for attaching equal importance to\u00a0 opposing viewpoints and Lalith said they had a hard time\u00a0figuring out from the references who was best!",
    "Neelan and GL produced perhaps the best Constitution for Sri Lanka we might have had, in 2000. It had an excellent\u00a0chapter on Fundamental Rights that reflected contemporary developments. It also had constructive proposals\u00a0for power sharing and the independence of the judiciary and public service from political control. Most importantly,\u00a0it replaced the Executive\u00a0Presidency with the tried and tested method of an Executive\u00a0branch with a Prime Minister and Cabinet responsible\u00a0to\u00a0 Parliament.",
    "Unfortunately a single provision that enabled President Kumaranatunga to become prime minister for the rest of her Presidential term, was used by the Opposition\u00a0led by Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe to tear up into pieces the document on the 2000\u00a0Constitution\u00a0on the floor of the House, when it was presented in Parliament, by Minister\u00a0GL Pieris. The government\u00a0fell, and this led to the first \u201ccohabitation\u201d in governance arrangement between President\u00a0Kumaranatunga of the SLFP, and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe of the UNP. The 2000 Constitution has never\u00a0entered the discussions on Constitutional reform that followed.",
    "A short period of \u201ccohabitation\u201d was followed by a General Election and a further short second term for President Kumaranatunge. The 17th Amendment was passed by Parliament at this time with the leadership of the JVP and provided for the first time Independent Commissions to strengthen public administration,\u00a0and a Constitutional Council empowered to make recommendations to the President on high post appointments to the judiciary\u00a0and public service",
    "Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected as Executive President in 2005. He was given a mandate to abolish the Executive\u00a0Presidency. However,\u00a0the focus of his administration was addressing the armed conflict in the North with his brother, who was appointed\u00a0Secretary of Defence. Winning the war in 2009 was a catalyst for a sea change in the political life of an experienced and respected\u00a0 politician, who had also related to an agenda of human rights. My husband appeared for him as petitioner, and won a fundamental rights case for him, and also successfully argued the\u00a0 famous Janagosha case on the right to\u00a0 peaceful political\u00a0 protest.",
    "From 2009 Mahinda Rajapaksa went on a different political\u00a0 path,\u00a0surrounded\u00a0by family and friends espousing a culture of political patronage that debilitated all institutions of governance. This was an inherent aspect of governance in this country even\u00a0 before that. However misuse of Presidential powers without any inhibitions, and family political patronage and\u00a0 \u00a0empowerment\u00a0 \u00a0and cronyism was carried to different and more significant levels. In a feudal culture the perception that the President was all powerful and could not be questioned created new levels of sycophancy or reluctance to express different\u00a0points of view in the administrative services.\u00a0 \u00a0This had a serious impact on all institutions and was replicated in the behaviour of Cabinet ministers and others\u00a0who became\u00a0 notorious for abuse of power and corruption. The Proportional Representation system with the focus on a Party machinery choice of candidates\u00a0also led to more and more incompetent persons being elected as members of Parliament.",
    "The 18th Amendment to the Constitution that saw a removal of the limitation on terms of the Executive President, a core concept in the 1978 Constitution embedded in Presidential power during a term of office, was perhaps an inevitable outcome. A President who\u00a0had been elected to office, promising\u00a0 to abolish the Executive Presidency was now quite comfortable with becoming a President for life. His cabinet and government was full of approval for\u00a0 this change. So also the Supreme Court in the judgment of Shirani Bandaranayaka CJ when the 18th Amendment was challenged in the Supreme Court. The environment of acceptance and passivity and self censorship in\u00a0 responding\u00a0 to this change\u00a0was such that there was silence even in academia on\u00a0 this\u00a0 very\u00a0controversial\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0 jurisprudence. It was the theme of my husband\u2019s oration for the Bar Association, in\u00a0 memory of\u00a0 a former President,\u00a0 Desmond Fernando PC.",
    "The protest against the worst excesses of Mahinda Rajapaksa led to its unexpected defeat and the election of President Maithripala Sirisena and what was described as a rainbow\u00a0coalition of political parties led by Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. President Sirisena promised to abolish the Executive\u00a0Presidency and was given this mandate by the majority of citizens\u00a0 who helped him get elected to office. This was also a personal commitment given to Maduluwawe Sobhita Thero who led the resistance to the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa government. However, in the first flush of victory he was persuaded to support a Constitutional Amendment\u00a0that would REDUCE presidential powers and transfer them to his Prime Minister,\u00a0Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. The draft Constitution of 2000 which provided for the abolition of the Executive Presidency was unfortunately not considered in this constitutional reform process.",
    "If anyone expected this change to facilitate cooperation between these two centres of power in one administration that was an impossible expectation. Perhaps it increased expectations on the part of the Prime Minister, and resistance on the part of the President\u00a0to the anticipated happy cohabitation. Inevitably the \u201cempowered\u201d Prime Minister had to experience the full brunt of Presidential anger when they had conflicting view points on the Arjuna Mahendran, Ravi Karunanayake and Aloysius\u00a0 related bond scam. A hurriedly and sometimes\u00a0 poorly drafted proviso in the 19th Amendment facilitated the Constitutional crisis of 2018 and the replacement of the 19th Amendment \u201cempowered\u201d Prime Minister with (of all people ) Mahinda Rajapaksa whom President Sirisena said he was fleeing from in anticipation of grave violence as a candidate in the Presidential election.",
    "When the Easter Sunday violence took place, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the empowered 19th Amendment Prime Minister, told the nation in\u00a0 a BBC interview that he could not be held responsible for the appalling and reckless lapses\u00a0in national security because he had been excluded by the President from the National Security Council and \u201cwas not in the loop\u201d.",
    "It is the 19th Amendment of the Sirisena/Wickremesinghe government which is the basis of the 21A (MoJ). The Gotabaya and\u00a0 Wickremesinghe government are telling us that this will be the best response in strengthening governance and satisfying the demand for systemic and institutional\u00a0change. And every one they address including the media and political parties\u00a0 (most recently Maithipala\u00a0Sirisena led SLFP) is applauding this initiative.",
    "The Opposition\u2019s counter arguments for the 21A (S) to abolish the Executive\u00a0Presidency appears to be falling\u00a0 on deaf ears, due to\u00a0 ignorance, political expediency\u00a0 or a\u00a0collective sense of amnesia. The only focus seems to be on a single\u00a0issue \u2013 whether or not to support an amendment prohibiting dual citizens from holding office that may lead to another Rajapaksa sibling being compelled to forfeit his national\u00a0list seat in Parliament. And that after facilitating\u00a0another person occupying a national seat in Parliament to become the country\u2019s Prime Minister.",
    "A new Constitution\u00a0for Sri Lanka as part of Incremental Constitutional Reform",
    "When Minister\u00a0Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe offers us the prospect of a new Constitution being drafted (after we have emerged from this crisis),\u00a0 he seems to have forgotten the much publicized\u00a0 efforts to do so during the Maithripala-Sirisena Ranil Wickremesinghe governments period in office. What emerged from the Constitution drafting Committee that Mr. Wickremesinghe himself chaired? Large and excellent reports by expert groups working on important areas of governance\u00a0were produced.\u00a0 \u00a0What happened to those reports? What also happened to the\u00a0report submitted\u00a0to government by the\u00a0 Lal Wijenayake\u00a0 Committee on Constitutional reform after islandwide consultations\u00a0over a period of time? What happened to the report of the Manouri Muttetuwegama Committee on Transitional Justice mechanisms? And the Truth and\u00a0 Reconciliation Mechanism law that was drafted at the request of the government by a committee chaired by me with a dedicated team of\u00a0 persons who gave their time freely without fees?",
    "Even more curious, what happened to the report of the Constitutional drafting Committee appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa? This committee was chaired by Romesh de Silva PC with, it is said, the leadership of Minister GL Pieris. Where is this draft Constitution and what is its approach to the Executive\u00a0Presidency and \u201csystemic and institutional change?\u201d",
    "Faced with a crisis of proportions and impact\u00a0 that has devastated the country it is incredible that we are now engaged in another round of political\u00a0 play acting on constitutional\u00a0reform.\u00a0Let us at\u00a0 least on this occasion take serious stock of the very real breakdown in governance that has led to this \u201cman made and voluntary economic disaster\u201d in a country renowned for its human development indicators in South Asia. In doing so let us recognize that we must abolish the Executive\u00a0Presidency NOW and not later. This requires heeding the voice of the Aragalaya, and supporting the 21A (S) that will abolish the Executive Presidency and will also bring with it the institutional and systemic\u00a0change in our governance that has been promised for decades by successive governments\u00a0but never realized due to narrow and selfish political agendas. Saying Yes to the\u00a021A (S) and No to the 21A (MoJ) which is a token gesture of Constitutional reform may be a last chance to save our country from further destabilization and \u201cman made\u201d disasters created through corrupt, inefficient and reckless governance.",
    "Heeding the Voice of the People, Constitutional Reform and the Referendum Concept",
    "The Rajapaksa governments 2005-2014 and 2019-2022\u00a0gave scant respect to the \u201cVoice of the People\u201d. Governments in which\u00a0 Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 had a leadership role, like the Yahapalanaya\u00a0government, 2015-2019, appointed many \u201cConsultative\u201d and Advisory\u201d Committees, on a range of important\u00a0 subjects of public concern, including Constitutional Reform. Yet the government consistently\u00a0discarded their\u00a0reports. Research on the functioning of these \u201cCommittees\u201d demonstrates that the Yahapalanaya period had more consultative Committees\u00a0than any other government. The record of law making and policy formulation in this period however\u00a0 demonstrates clearly government\u00a0\u00a0inaction rather than action for change.",
    "So \u201cconsultation and listening to the voice of the People and experts\u201d can mean nothing more than political rhetoric. This can also lead to unexpected consequences. The failure to improve and achieve\u00a0 intra-party\u00a0democracy, in the UNP, the party led by Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, despite\u00a0the many Reports commissioned and Committees appointed, eventually led to a significant group breaking away, and forming a new party as Samagi Jana Balavegaya.",
    "These\u00a0experiences hardly inspire confidence in the Prime Minister\u2019s address to the nation, saying he will appoint 12 or 15 \u201cCommittees\u201d for effective public administration and financial management.\u00a0 A large\u00a0 Expert Advisory\u00a0\u00a0Committee\u00a0of eminent economists, has also been appointed to\u00a0 the Central Bank. A promise has\u00a0 \u00a0been made by the Prime Minister\u00a0 to\u00a0 provide\u00a0opportunities\u00a0for youth participation, including from the Aragalaya, in some of these Committees. The latter initiative is said to help youth\u00a0 to understand the difference between protest and participatory democracy!",
    "It is time that our politicians understand what participatory democracy means, and that the people can see the difference\u00a0 between\u00a0this concept, and the \u201cCommittee Consultation\u201d fetish that is a diversionary political maneuver to resist or avoid\u00a0 change.\u00a0\u00a0The Constitutional requirement of having a Referendum and hearing the voice of the People, to initiate\u00a0major Constitutional reform, must also\u00a0not be permitted to prevent efforts to\u00a0\u00a0abolish\u00a0 the Executive Presidency through Constitutional reform. This is also a demand of the Aragalaya and street protests, which include a large and diverse\u00a0youth population.",
    "Article 3 of our Constitution articulates\u00a0the concept of the Sovereignty of the People as including the \u201cpowers of governance\u201d. Article\u00a04 clarifies the MANNER in which the PEOPLE\u2019S POWER OF GOVERNANCE\u00a0can be EXERCISED AND ENJOYED. It is on the basis of this\u00a0concept that it can be argued that the President\u00a0in exercising the Executive power of the People\u00a0with a Prime Minister and Cabinet, collectively responsible for the government of the country under Article 43, has a LEGAL and not just an ethical obligation to fullfil his responsibilities of good governance, preventing\u00a0 the type of\u00a0 economic and political crisis confronting the nation today.",
    "International law is considered \u201claw\u201d that creates legal obligations, despite the limitations on enforcement. Consequently, incapacity\u00a0for enforcement no longer indicates that there is no legal obligation. A President and Cabinet Ministers who fail in their legal obligations in governance, can be called upon by the People to resign. It is the lack of a procedure for\u00a0 enforcing\u00a0 that legal obligation of resignation, except by\u00a0 impeachment of the President,\u00a0 that has contributed to the urgent need for\u00a0 Constitutional reform\u00a0 to ABOLISH the Presidency in the executive branch of government.",
    "The 19th Amendment made the\u00a0 President liable for a violation of rights and for the Supreme Court to provide \u201cjust and equitable relief\u201d for such a violation. This provision was retained in the 20th Amendment. The possibility of a petition for violation of citizen rights, and a call for just and equitable\u00a0relief in the form of a court order on resignation, in light of the serious responsibilities in governance under the Constitution, may seem theoretical and only aspirational at this time.",
    "The Attorney\u00a0General\u00a0has advised\u00a0that the\u00a0Presidential status in the executive branch\u00a0 \u00a0cannot be removed without a two thirds Majority support in Parliament, and a Referendum.\u00a0 The Referendum issue, and its impact on 21 A (S) is therefore an additional concern. This seems an obstacle in\u00a0 effecting a critically important\u00a0 Constitutional change, in responding\u00a0 to our political and economic crisis.",
    "The Constitution has a clear provision in Article 83 which indicates that a two third majority and a Referendum are\u00a0 required for the amendment or repeal of\u00a0Article 3. Therefore Article 4 on the\u00a0 status of the President in the Executive branch of governance is NOT covered by the Referendum\u00a0clause. The requirement for\u00a0a Referendum\u00a0is thus an interpretive perspective, based on jurisprudence in the Supreme\u00a0Court linking Articles 3 and 4. That jurisprudence\u00a0is also not consistent.",
    "In the 20th Amendment case counsel cited earlier cases linking Articles three and four and argued that since the concept of Presidential power had been\u00a0significantly modified by the 19th Amendment, a Referendum\u00a0was also necessary to go back to the earlier concept of near absolute\u00a0 Presidential executive power. The court in its opinion rejected this interpretation, and did not\u00a0 follow the jurisprudence\u00a0linking Articles three and four on the meaning of executive power. It is this interpretation\u00a0 that is being cited in arguing that 21 A (MoJ)\u00a0 seeking to only reduce Presidential powers that can be passed without a Referendum.",
    "There is nothing to prevent the other argument being canvassed again in litigation on the current Constitutional\u00a0Bills. Besides the Referendum issue can also be resolved if the Supreme Court follows the approach it took in the Port City\u00a0Bill litigation, where the Court decided that it was not necessary to consult the Provincial\u00a0Councils on a matter that required\u00a0their consent, when it was impossible to do so as these bodies were not functioning at the time. The current situation and an argument that it is not possible to have a Referendum, in the current context, is supported by that case.",
    "The lack of clarity on the issue of the need for a\u00a0Referendum does not mean that this should\u00a0 be used to prevent support for the 21A(S) that seeks to abolish the Executive Presidency. Besides holding such a Referendum is\u00a0not as complicated and expensive as a General Election, that we cannot afford at this time. All that a citizen is required to do is to say \u201cyes\u00a0or no\u201d to a single\u00a0question, of the abolition of the Executive Presidency. They will be happy\u00a0to provide the piece of\u00a0 paper for this task to the Election Commissioner\u2019s officials, if the State cannot afford to provide this, rather in the manner they are collecting the one rupee coins, after\u00a0 the Minister said the State subsidizes\u00a0the cost of\u00a0 a rupee for a litre of fuel!",
    "If the Referendum issue is\u00a0 too complicated to resolve in initiating Constitutional reform\u00a0to abolish the Executive\u00a0Presidency the time may be ripe for demanding that the President exercises his powers under Article 86 of the Constitution to \u201csubmit to the People at a Referendum any matter which in his view is of national\u00a0importance\u201d. He claims that he has a mandate from 6.9 million people to complete his term. That is now an issue of public concern for\u00a0 him as well as the People. He can hear the Peoples\u2019 voice,\u00a0 on\u00a0 this matter through a Referendum, helping to also\u00a0 solve the differences in viewpoint\u00a0between him and the Peoples\u2019\u00a0Movement\u00a0of\u00a0 Aragalaya.",
    "Many of the persons involved\u00a0 in this movement for systemic and institutional\u00a0change\u00a0 are the youth of a next generation, who have come together from diverse communities that link across class, caste and race,\u00a0 calling for a different approach to accountable\u00a0 governance, realizing\u00a0 how poor and reckless government\u00a0 \u00a0impacts\u00a0 the lives of the People and their future. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has cited a literary source, the German playwright Bertol\u00a0 \u00a0Brecht\u2019s Caucasian Chalk\u00a0 Circle to explain the manner in which he will perform\u00a0 as the Prime Minister of the country.",
    "Perhaps he as well as\u00a0\u00a0citizens, especially the youth, engaged in the Aragalaya\u00a0 should peruse the poem\u00a0 of WS Senior, an Englishman who was a poet and\u00a0 educationist in colonial Sri Lanka. His ashes are interred in Haputale with an epitaph from a poem he wrote on leaving this country: \u201coh my soul it will break with longing, it can never be good bye\u201d. His poem \u201cThe Call of Lanka\u201d has these lines:",
