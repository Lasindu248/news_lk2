  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has decided to donate the entire revenue from ticket sales of the upcoming Australia tour of Sri Lankan games to the welfare of the people suffering from the ongoing economic crisis, an SLC spokesman said.",
    "Eight games between the two countries will be played as day and night games, which are expected to be played under floodlights and consume more power than the daylight games. Two one-day games will be played in Kandy, Pallekele ground, while the other six matches in the shorter version of the game will be played in Colombo.",
    "The SLC\u2019s executive committee has taken the decision to donate the money following a request made by the Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe.",
    "\u201cThe entire ticket money from the five one-day games, three T20 games, and the two tests will be donated for the people to have their essential items,\u201d he said.",
    "The first Twenty20 (T20) starts on June 7 at 1900 hours. The tour goes until the end of July.",
    "SLC has already made nearly 2 million US dollars of donations for two hospitals in Colombo to buy medicines.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing the worst economic crisis in its history with people facing a shortage of essential goods including fuel, cooking gas, milk powder, medicines, and foods.",
    "Many people are forced to wait in queues for hours or days to get their essentials as President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government has exhausted the country\u2019s dollar reserves. Tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs or earning less because of lower demand and the closure of businesses.\u00a0(Colombo/June 06/2022)"
