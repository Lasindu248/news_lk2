    "Analysts say the popularity of President Rajapaksa and the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has taken a nosedive amid Sri Lanka\u2019s prevailing economic crisis, one of the worst in the island nation\u2019s history. Daily power cuts, long queues for fuel and other essentials have become a common feature of everyday life in the country, and people have taken to the streets in bursts of spontaneous protest.",
    "Social media has also served as a site of protest and agitation, media commentators say.",
    "A spokesperson for the president\u2019s media division was not immediately available for comment. (Colombo/Mar31/2022)"
