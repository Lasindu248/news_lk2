    "Some have brought their own tents while organizers too are now capable of providing tents for those who wish\u00a0to remain",
    "For years, rulers have distanced communities for their own political benefits, but this time, the true feeling of Sri Lankanness has been resurrected",
    "\u2018GotaGoGama\u2019 \u2013 that is what the protesters call the \u2018Agitation Site\u2019 at the Galle Face Green which has now transformed into a colony of people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. What commenced as a mass protest on April 9 now continues to its fourth consecutive day. Donations now come in handy to boost the spirits of protesters. One can find everything from sanitary napkins to toiletries, water bottles, dry rations including tea leaves, milk powder, biscuits, short eats etc. Some have brought their own tents while organizers too are now capable of providing tents for those who wish to remain. Irrespective of religion, race, caste, gender, age and other differences, people are supporting each other to overthrow a corrupt regime. For years, rulers have distanced communities for their own political benefits, but this time, the true feeling of Sri Lankanness has been resurrected. Protesters aim to continue their mission even during the dawn of the New Year and as such, this movement marks a historic milestone in the political history of Sri Lanka.",
    "A group of school friends have reunited to provide protesters with refreshments. \u201cI got together with my school friends and my wife gathered her school friends and we are providing protesters with tea, coffee and refreshments,\u201d said Kosala Guruge. \u201cThere\u2019s a common feeling of harmony. Everyone of us is affected by the crisis, but the President, Prime Minister and the cabinet are leading luxurious lives. Therefore they don\u2019t feel the hardships. They don\u2019t have to languish in queues, they don\u2019t have shortages of gas or milk powder. People are not in a position to do voluntary service at this point, but they have still managed to provide protesters at the\u00a0Galle Face Green with water, food, tea, dry rations, toiletries and all other items. When there\u2019s a shortage of gas cylinders in the country, we managed to find one to make tea. Even though we say Sri Lankans have an islander\u2019s mentality they are carrying out",
    "these protests in a peaceful manner. In other countries there have been bloodshed when sending leaders home,\u201d said Guruge.",
    "A mother and her son were having a conversation inside a tent when we approached them. Even though Tharusha Deemantha had dreams to travel around the country, he is now at Galle Face Green with his mother. \u201cI am 20 years old and I bought this tent to travel around the country,\u201d he said when asked why he wanted to join the protest. \u201cBut now there is no petrol and I don\u2019t have a way to travel. I had a lot of dreams that a boy would usually have; buy a car, a house etc. But the present situation doesn\u2019t favour us in anyway. In order to achieve our dreams we need to change the system and that is why I came here to be a part of the protest and be a part of the change,\u201d said Deemantha.",
    "Tharusha\u2019s mother Helen Brito is a teacher and she feels that there\u2019s no hope for the next generations. \u201cTheir dreams remain to be\u00a0dreams,\u201d she said expressing her disappointment towards the incumbent regime. \u201cI came here with my son to give a little push and ensure that he achieves his dreams. I\u2019m a teacher, but what I have to say is that there is no country for our children. We are trying to save the little bit of this island that is left and we will continue to stay here until they leave,\u201d said Helen.",
    "\u201cAll donations are from the people, for the people\u201d \u2013 Ranasinghe",
    "As you move towards \u2018Gotagogama\u2019 the protest site that has been rechristened by the protesters, one could see several canopies with stocks of essential items. Here you can get anything you need from water bottles to sanitary napkins to dry rations, biscuits, food etc. \u201cPeople have been contacting us to send donations and we keep all of them in one place,\u201d said Kasumi Ranasinghe, a volunteer who handles the collection and distribution of items. \u201cProtesters come here and take what they want. Items range from sanitary napkins to toilet paper, medicine, biscuits, tea leaves, milk powder, water bottles, beverages food and a range of other items that can sustain people coming here. None of these donations is from politicians, it\u2019s from the people for the people. For ifthar people donated dates and snacks. This will continue until the President and the Prime Minister step down,\u201d affirmed Kasumi.",
    "\u201cThe crowd will remain during the dawn of the New Year\u201d \u2013 Senarathne",
    "Sri Lankans irrespective of gender, ethnicity, religion, race, age and other differences have gathered at the Galle Face Green. The\u00a0feeling of unity among protesters is mutual. \u201cPeople have gathered here to voice their disappointment towards the President and Prime Minister,\u201d said Nuwan Senarathne. \u201cNone of them is politically motivated and all these people have volunteered to spend their valuable time on the streets and protest against a corrupt regime, irrespective of rain or shine. This protest has been organised in a manner that it continues until this corrupt regime steps down. Hence, by the looks of it the crowd will remain during the dawn of the New Year on April 14 as well. This is a force that emerged from the people, for the people and this has never happened in the history of politics in Sri Lanka. All those who have gathered here are Sri Lankans. Rulers wanted to divide people to gain their own political",
    "its core and further distanced people from other ethnicities,\u201d said Senarathne.",
    "A group of friends has gotten together to offer chai and coffee for the protesters. \u201cWe have chai and coffee. Coffee has caffeine and it\u2019s a booster. I want everyone who comes here and shouts on behalf of everyone in this country to be energised. I don\u2019t want to give them something that makes them dull. What you see here is a beautiful story of unity in diversity. I\u2019m a Muslim and I\u2019m fasting today, but I got married to a Sinhalese girl. That\u2019s unity,\u201d said Farzan Sheriff."
