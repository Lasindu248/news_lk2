    "Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt for the time in its history last month.",

    "Former Sri Lanka central bank staff have written an open letter to the embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa urging him to keep Mr Weerasinghe in the post.",
    "\u201cIf anyone is contemplating to remove him from his position as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, we see it as a highly unpatriotic move with entirely ulterior motives,\u201d they wrote.",
