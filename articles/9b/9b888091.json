    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s health ministry on Thursday (21) reversed a recent relaxation of the country\u2019s COVID-19 face mask mandate, making it once again compulsory to wear a mask outdoors in view of ongoing public protests.",
    "In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Health Services Director General Dr Asela Gunawardena said the relaxation, previously announced by Health Minister Channa Jayasumna on Monday (19), has been temporarily suspended.",
    "\u201cConsidering the large public gatherings currently taking place in the country, lifting of the mandatory requirement to wear face masks outdoors is temporariliy suspended. Masks should be worn outdoors as done before,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka has seen growing public protests against the government over its handling of the country\u2019s ongoing economic crisis. Thousands of people have been gathering outdoors, often in close proximity, around the country demanding the resignation of the president and others in power. Mask-wearing has been observed to be lax among protestors.",
    "On Monday (18), Minister Jayasumana said it was no longer mandatory to wear a face mask outdoors, and the mandate was going to be limited to indoors events and public transport.",
    "The decision was met with criticism from various parties including health experts.",
    "Professor in Microbiology at the Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sri Jayewardenepura Neelika Malavige said on Tuesday that, despite the very low number of cases and hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in Sri Lanka right now, it would be advisable to wear masks in large outdoor gatherings.",
    "\u201cMany countries are have relaxed their COVID restrictions. Masks are not worn in many countries, even indoors. Despite infections surging and increase in hospitalizations. Best that we have a safer approach, given the circumstances,\u201d she tweeted.",
    "Social media users, many of who have been agitating against the government, also expressed scepticism over the decision, urging people to disregard the health ministry\u2019s announcement and continue to wear masks in order to prevent a possible cluster and a resultant lockdown.",
    "Deputy Director of Health Services Dr Hemantha Herath told EconomyNext on Tuesday (19) that the decision was made following a notable decrease in daily COVID-19 cases of fewer than a 50 a day.",
    "\u201cOther countries did this a long time ago, but we delayed it in Sri Lanka. But if people act irresponsibly indoors, then cases can again increase in the coming days,\u201d he said.",
    "According to Gunawardena\u2019s statement on Thursday, other measures stipulated in Monday\u2019s health ministry statement are still valid. The stipulations in question are as follows:",
    "The wearing of the scrub suit by health staff which was introduced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic should be limited to COVID-19 wards and ICUs with COVID-19 patients while the practice of wearing Personal Protective Equipment (e.g. Overalls, Coveralls, Head caps, Shoe covers, boots etc) should be as in pre COVID-19 times and worn only in ICUs and if required in COVID-19 wards.",
    "The surgical cap should not be worn when examining patients/working in wards/clinics and compulsory COVID-19 testing (PCR/Rapid Antigen Test) for all patients and bystanders should not be done.",
    "Authorities also said visitors of patients coming to healthcare facilities should not be restricted as a measure of preventing COVpD-19 except for visitors for immunocompromised patients such as renal transplant patients etc and Patient examination in the OPD/Clinics/Wards should be done as in the pre COVID-19 times without any additional distance or barriers.
