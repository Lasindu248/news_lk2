    "The Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA) vehemently condemns the atrocious and unwarranted attacks on 9 May 2022 on peaceful protestors, inflicted by unruly gangs focused on creating unrest and mayhem. We consider it a direct affront to the freedom of speech and peaceful assembly guaranteed by the supreme law of the country. We call upon the authorities to initiate an impartial investigation into untoward incidents and make every effort to bring the perpetrators before justice.",
    "We denounce in unison all such acts of violence throughout the country and express our sorrow and sympathy to all who suffered injury and convey our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. We appeal to the public to remain calm and exercise restraint over induced emotions to ensure restoration of law and order.",

    "In conclusion, the OPA calls upon the President and leaders of all political parties to leave aside their differences and come together to resolve this impasse with expediency whilst being cognisant of the aspirations of all citizens of the country."
