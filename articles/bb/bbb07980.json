    "Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa today said there maybe a conspiracy behind the ongoing power crisis which needed to be probed.",
    "He said the President had instructed to provide an uninterrupted power supply to people and it had been discussed with officials.",
    "\"We don\u2019t know why power outages are continuing. If it\u2019s an act of sabotage then it needs to be probed,\" Namal said.",
    "If statements are being made saying that there won\u2019t be power outages if adequate fuel is supplied and if power outages continue, then there\u2019s a problem there. Perhaps it\u2019s a hidden conspiracy, he said."
