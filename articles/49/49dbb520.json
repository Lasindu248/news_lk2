    "SLNSS said \"The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery was able to resume operations with the commencement of unloading crude oil from the freight tanker anchored in Sri Lankan waters for more than two months awaiting settlement to be made through US dollars.\"",
    "However, they said diesel and petrol will be released first, followed by naphtha for power generation and kerosene at the end.",
