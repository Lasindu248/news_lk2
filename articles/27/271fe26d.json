    "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed a boat from Sri Lanka was intercepted on Saturday morning while illegally en route to Australia.",
    "In a major development, Mr Morrison confirmed \u2014 in the spirit of \u201cfull transparency\u201d\u2014 that the boat had been intercepted by Australian authorities.",
    "\u201cI can confirm that there\u2019s been an interception of a vessel en route to Australia,\u201d Mr Morrison told reporters, after casting his vote in his local electorate of Cook, the Herald Sun reported.",
    "\u201cThat vessel has been intercepted in accordance with the policies of the government and they\u2019re following those normal protocols.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been here to stop this boat, but in order for me to be there to stop those that may come from here, you need to vote Liberal and Nationals today.",
    "\u201cIn the interests of full transparency, in the middle of an election campaign, the Labor Party was advised of this and a statement has been issued by the border protection authorities.\u201d",
    "It was a different tact to when Mr Morrison was Immigration Minister and proclaimed there would be no discussion of \u201con water matters\u201d when Australia began turning back asylum seeker vessels at sea in November 2013.",
    "It is understood about 15 people were on board the vessel that was intercepted by Australian authorities off the west coast of Christmas Island after almost making it to land"
