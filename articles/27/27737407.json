  "body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) today confirmed that they had decided to launch their country wide trade union action from midnight and it may result in another countrywide power outage.",
    "They said the decision was taken after discussions failed with the Power and Energy Minister regarding the amendment of the Electricity Act, which would clear the path for the Adani Group's proposal for the 500MW Wind Power Project in Mannar and Pooneryn to materialise without following the due process.",
    "\u201cThe discussion we had with the Minister was not successful as the Minister decided to go ahead with the proposed amendment and to pass it in the Parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "The Minister did not listen to what we had to say regarding the handing over of the project according to the Adani Group\u2019s proposal. Later the minister left the discussion and we are left with no choice, they said.",
    "\"So the Union has decided to launch its trade union action from midnight,\" they said.",
    "The CEB Engineers will refrain from working with all power plants and grid substations from midnight while shutting power plants down for safety.",
    "Consequently a island-wide power outage is expected to materialize from tomorrow morning.",
    "The CEBEU claimed that the main purpose behind the amendment was to allow India\u2019s Adani Group's unsolicited proposal for a 500 MW Wind Power Project in Mannar and Pooneryn, which would mark the end of the country\u2019s competitive bidding process in power generation.
