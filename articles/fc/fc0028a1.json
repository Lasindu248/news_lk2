    "Two government sources told Economy Next that two SriLankan Airline flights to Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 UL 304 and UL-306 \u2013 on Thursday, April 19th were diverted to MRIA for refuelling amid \u201cconcerns over fuel shortage\u201d at the BIA.",

    "When asked if the BIA does not have enough fuel he said:\u201d \u201cWe do, but we are managing. We have two tanks \u2013 one at Mattala and one at BIA.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat happened was fuel in Mattala was reserved for European flights. But since they reduced after the Russian-Ukrainian war, the fuel was just being stored there,\u201d Sumanasekara said denying speculations of fuel shortage at the BIA.",
