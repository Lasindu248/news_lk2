    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s deputy speaker of parliament Ranjith Siyambalapitiya on Friday (08) temporarily withdrew his resignation from the position until the end of April after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa declined to accept it the previous day.",
    "Siyambalapitiya told parliament that when refusing to accept his resignation, the president had provided compelling reasons for him to stay on. Chief among these, the MP said, was the need to ensure that parliamentary democracy remained intact during the present political crisis.",
    "The government MP sent his letter of resignation to the president on Tuesday (05) following his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)\u2019s decision to quit the government.",
    "But since the president\u2019s reasoning has been acceptable to the SLFP, said Siyambalapitiya, he had decided to stay on till the end of the month, on the condition that he be not afforded any privileges that come with the position.",
    "\u201cI will only hold office till the end of the month, by which think the present tensions will have defused since people of this country are used to seven decades of democracy,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka is in the midst of a political crisis brought about by a worsening economic crisis, with the government on the verge of losing its majority in parliament.",
    "Protests have erupted islandwide demanding the resignation of President Rajapaksa and his government.",
    "The main opposition on Friday launched a campaign to collect signatures for a no confidence motion against the government. (Colombo/Apr08/2022)"
