    "While urging the President, Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and all MPs to take effective steps to put the country in order, the Mahanayaka Theras of the four chapters today said they will be forced to issue a Sangha Convention if they fail to do so.",
    "The statement issued by the Mahanayaka theras of Malwathu, Asgiri, Amarapura and Ramanya chapters called for the appointment of a multi party cabinet, repealing of the 20th Amendment which has taken away the checks and balances between the legislature and the executive, and to refrain from suppressing mass protests.",
    "\u201cThe new cabinet which was appointed recently will not help resolve the present economic and political crisis,\u201d the Mahanayaka theras said.",
    "\u201cWe also condemn the recent killing at the mass protest in Rambukana on Tuesday,\u201d the statement added.",
    "\u201cWe urge the President, Prime Minister and all Members of Parliament to be sensitive to the need of the hour. People in this nation have performed their duty to the fullest. We therefore urge all politicians who represent the government and the opposition to be more sensitive as the hour has come for them to perform their duty,\u201d the statement added.(Shane Seneviratne)"
