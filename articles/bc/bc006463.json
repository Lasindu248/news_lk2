    "(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visibly irritated, on Saturday demanded Western nations provide a fraction of the military hardware in their stock piles and asked whether they were afraid of Moscow.",
    "Several countries have promised to send anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles as well as small arms but Zelenskiy said Kyiv needed tanks, planes and anti-ship systems.",
    "\u201cThat is what our partners have, that is what is just gathering dust there. This is all for not only the freedom of Ukraine, but for the freedom of Europe,\u201d he said in a late night video address.",
    "Ukraine needed just 1% of NATO\u2019s aircraft and 1% of its tanks and would not ask for more, he said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve already been waiting 31 days. Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation?\u201d he said.",
    "Zelenskiy has repeatedly insisted that Russia will seek to expand further into Europe if Ukraine falls. NATO though does not back his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine on the grounds this could provoke a wider war.",
    "Earlier in the day Zelenskiy talked to Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda and expressed disappointment that Russian-made fighter aircraft in Eastern Europe had not yet been transferred to Ukraine, Zelenskiy\u2019s office said in a statement.",
    "\u201cThe price of procrastination with planes is thousands of lives of Ukrainians,\u201d the office quoted him as saying. Zelenskiy said Poland and the United States had both stated their readiness to make a decision on the planes.",
    "Earlier this month, Washington rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany to be used to replenish Ukraine\u2019s air force."
