    "\u201cAssistance by the IMF will take about six months to come to us and it will come in tranches,\u201d Minister Peiris was quoted by Reuters. \u201cDuring the intervening period, we need to find funds to keep our people supplied with essentials.\u201d",
    "This will be the second USD 500 million India has provided in fuel credit to a Sri Lanka government battling the country\u2019s worst financial crisis in living memory.",
    "The first line of credit was used up earlier this month after a shipment of 120,000 tons of diesel and 40,000 tons of petrol.",
    "Massive protests broke out on Tuesday after fuel reserves ran low.",
    "Thousands of angry motorists burned tyres and blocked a major road leading into capital Colombo, news agency AFP reported citing police and local officials.",
