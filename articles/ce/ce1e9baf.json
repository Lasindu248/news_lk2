    "States forensic audit should be done to identify those behind it",
    "Charges Govt. policy errors and economic crisis is criminal negligence",
    "SJB MP Harsha de Silva yesterday said a forensic audit should be carried out with regards to International Sovereign Bond (ISB) payments made recently in which businessmen linked to the Government allegedly benefitted.",
    "Speaking in Parliament, de Silva said he when the Government was readying to pay $ 500 million ISB\u00a0 payments in January, he had strongly advised the Government against it, as the country would run out of money to finance our essential imports. However, the Government had ignored the warnings and was determined to make the payment.",
    "\u201cI later revealed that a scam had been committed as (ISBs) worth $ 1,000 were sold at a 50% discount for $ 500 to crony businessmen. Moreover, the cronies that purchased these ISBs made 300-400% in just quarterly interest revenue. Thus, I urged the then Minister of Justice Ali Sabry to immediately investigate this, however, nothing came out of this,\u201d the SJB MP said. He said a forensic audit should be carried out to find out who decided to make this reckless payment and just who benefitted.",
    "\u201cThe people responsible need to be behind bars for steering Sri Lanka into the largest and most disastrous socioeconomic crisis since independence,\u201d he said, adding that 22 million people are suffering due to inconsiderate policy errors and those responsible should be accountable for this economic mess, as it is criminal negligence."
