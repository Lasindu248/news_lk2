    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee was quoted t 260/280 to the US dollar as the market opened on Friday after closing at 255/265 to the US dollar Thursday, dealers said as banks cautiously sought to establish a market clearing price.",
    "The highest deal done was around 265 to the US dollar, but there was some interbank trading.",
    "Some exporters have also started to convert, market participants said.",
    "Economists have called for rate hike to slow aggregate demand and help support the rupee and also contain inflation.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee is under pressure due to liquidity injections made to enforce low interest rates.",
    "Exchange rates are determined not buy trade but the monetary anchor in operation.",
    "In order to operate a fixed exchange rate short term rates have to be allowed to float as rupee reserves of the banking system changes according to interventions made by the central bank (unsterilized interventions).",
    "East Asia and South Asian nations like Nepal (1.6) and Bhutan (1-1) has maintained such pegs with the Indian rupee for over 70 years. Maldives also has a fairly credible peg with the US dollar.",
    "Countries that float cleanly with an inflation target (reserve money determined by inflation) and do not intervene in forex markets also have strong currencies.",
    "However intermediate regimes which are neither fixed nor floating get into trouble by printing money to manipulate rates and have to steeply depreciate to avoid forex shortages, resulting in social unrest.",
    "In a floating exchange rate, there is no intervention and no requirement to sterilize interventions with newly printed money, helping stabilize the currency.",
    "However if the policy rate is low, the central bank will automatically print money through open market operations to accommodate the rising prices including through depreciation, triggering a self-feeding inflation spiral analysts say.  (Colombo/Mar11/2022)"
