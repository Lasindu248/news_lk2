    "Providore, the online grocery store co-founded by Sri Lankan cricketing legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, is redefining online shopping in Sri Lanka by bringing freshness, quality and on-time delivery to every customer\u2019s doorstep.",
    "All Providore produce is of the freshest quality as the fruits and vegetables are delivered to their modern processing centre daily. Here, each item is carefully quality checked, cleaned, packed and stored in a specialized optimum temperature-controlled storage, ready to be delivered directly to the customer as and when required by them.",
    "When it comes to deliveries, the Providore Customer Service Associates (CSAs) have been specially trained to use the given mapping software to accurately find the location of the customer instead of calling numerous times. Additionally, while the customers are given the freedom to schedule their deliveries, the CSA ensures that the package is delivered exactly during the allocated time slot chosen by the customer. This provides customers greater freedom and convenience as they are able to plan their deliveries based on their work schedule and availability at the given delivery location. This is very convenient for individuals working from home and especially for busy mothers who have to manage several things on the home front. Using Providore, they are able to easily order the items they require and get them delivered when they want so that they can plan their cooking for the day easily, saving them time and reducing their stress. Furthermore, considering the customers\u2019 need for immediate fulfillment of orders Providore is now available on UBER and PickMe as well.",

When it comes to customers who are working from home, especially busy mothers running their households, they will find our deliveries very convenient as they can select the time slot for the package to be delivered so that they can plan their cooking and meals.
