    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has made its stance clear on the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister and called for clear timeline for crucial constitutional reforms.",
    "Following is the full statement issued by BASL President PC Saliya Pieris and Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi.",
    "The Executive Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) notes that the President has appointed MP Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.",
    "The appointment of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers are important steps to restore economic and political stability in Sri Lanka. As such it is necessary that such appointments are made in a manner which will establish public confidence.",
    "On the 23 April, the BASL submitted its Proposals to the President to restore political and economic stability in Sri Lanka. The Management Committee of the Bar Association met the President on his invitation on the 8 May at the President\u2019s House at his invitation in order to discuss the said Proposals. On that day the President indicated broad agreement with the Proposals including the establishment of a Government of National Unity. In the said Proposals the BASL Bar Association set out its proposals on establishing a Government of National Unity as follows:",
    "\u201cEstablish an Interim Government of National Unity consisting of 15 Cabinet Ministers. The Prime Minister to be a Member of Parliament who is able to establish a consensus among all political parties recognised by the Speaker in Parliament on the national economy and to enact necessary reforms.\u201d",
    "The essence of the proposal was that in the face of the present political and economic instability it was necessary to appoint a Prime Minister who is able to establish a consensus among all political parties within Parliament, rather than merely relying on the existence of a parliamentary majority.",
    "This proposal is fundamental to achieving the overall requirement of the Proposals which was to establish a \u2018stable Government with the ability to carry out reforms domestically and the ability/credibility to negotiate with the IMF, other multilateral agencies, and friendly countries to help Sri Lanka get out of the economic crisis. The ability to carry out domestic reforms necessarily envisages a Government which can secure the confidence of the People.",
    "The Executive Committee of the BASL is of the view that Wickremesinghe should at the earliest possible stage demonstrate his ability to establish a consensus among the political parties in Parliament and endeavour to build a representative Government of National Unity to implement a Common Minimum Programme (CMP) in the interests of the people.",
    "It is also imperative that the Government establishes a clear timeline to introduce critical constitutional amendments proposed by the BASL, including the introduction of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution and the abolition of the executive presidency. In this period of tremendous uncertainty, disaffection and suffering it is vital that the new Government acts with transparency and purpose of vision so as to restore confidence among the citizens of this country and the various international and domestic actors whose assistance is required in this moment of crisis."
