    "Many believe that Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe has the flair for providing political leadership for a economic revival",
    "He faces formidable challenges as Prime Minister of a failed, bankrupt state",
    "Wickremesinghe has been the target of escalated insults, jibes, taunts and invectives after being appointed premier",
    "The all-powerful President Mahinda Rajapaksa was seemingly invincible at that time. The chief opposition UNP Leader Ranil Wicremesinghe was perceived by many as a \u201cserial loser\u201d who could not defeat Mahinda. There were some in the UNP who were conspiring to seize the leadership from Ranil",
    "Ranil\u00a0 Wicremesinghe\u00a0 was part of the\u00a0 Junius Richard Jayewardene led\u00a0 \u201cgreen elephant\u201d\u00a0 juggernaut\u00a0 that swept the general elections of July 21st 1977\u00a0 winning 141 of the 168 seats then in Parliament. He has been in Parliament continuously since then as an MP except for a short break from August 2020 to June 2021.\u00a0 It is an indicator of Ranil\u2019remarkable resilience",
    "Ranil\u00a0 Sriyan Wickremesinghe known as Ranil is in the seat of power again as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the sixth time. The new Prime Minister was neither elected to office by the people in a general election nor endorsed by a majority of MP\u2019s in Parliament. Ranil is the leader of the United National Party (UNP) that had been roundly defeated at the last Parliamentary poll. He is the sole representative of the UNP in Parliament now. From lone MP to new Prime Minister was how some newspapers described his assumption of office.",
    "Ranil was virtually catapulted into office through very peculiar circumstances. He faces formidable challenges as Prime Minister of a failed, bankrupt state. The ramifications of Wickremesinghe\u2019s appointment as Prime Minister, the intricacies of the current political environment and the nature of play in Parliament in the future, would be delved into in greater detail in the second part of this article.",
    "The 1977 poll was the last parliamentary election conducted under the old first past the post winner system. Ranil himself contested and won the newly created Biyagama constituency with a majority of 6769 votes. He polled 22,045. H.A.David Hapangama of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) came second with 15,276 votes. Biyagama was carved out of the Kelaniya and Mahara electorates in the demarcation of 1976",
    "As for now I am extracting a few inspiring paragraphs from the special statement made by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on May 16, 2022. Ranil bared the truth about the perilous state of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and that he has accepted the challenge of trying to resurrect it. He called upon everyone to support him in this endeavour. Here are the relevant paragraphs-:",
    "\u201cLast Thursday, I accepted office as the Prime Minister. I did not request this position. In face of the challenging situation facing the country, the President invited me to take up this position. I assumed this duty not only as a political leader, but also as national leader who has benefited from free education at the Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo.",
    "\u201cThe next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives. We must prepare ourselves to make some sacrifices and face the challenges of this period.",
    "\u201cI have no desire to hide the truth and to lie to the public. Although these facts are unpleasant and terrifying, this is the true situation. For a short period, our future will be even more difficult than the tough times that we have passed. We will face considerable challenges and adversity. However, this period will not be long. In the coming months, our foreign allies will assist us. They have already pledged their support. Therefore, we will have to patiently bear the next couple of months.However, we can overcome this situation. Doing so will require taking a new path.",
    "\u201cWe will build a nation without queues for kerosene, gas, and fuel; a nation free of power outages, a nation with plentiful resources where agriculture can freely flourish; a nation where the future of the youth is secure; a nation where people\u2019s labour need not be wasted in queues and in struggles; a nation where everyone can lead their lives freely with three square meals a day.\u201d",
    "\u201cI am undertaking a dangerous challenge. In the Caucasian Chalk Circle, Grusha crossed the broken rope bridge carrying a child that was not her own. This is an even more difficult undertaking. The precipice is deep and its bottom cannot be seen. The bridge is made of thin glass and there is no handrail. I am wearing shoes with sharp nails that cannot be removed. My task is to safely take the child to the other side.",
    "\u201cI am accepting this challenge for our nation. My goal and dedication is not to save an individual, a family, or a party. My objective is to save all the people of this country and the future of our younger generation. I will undertake this task willingly risking my life if needed and will overcome the challenges facing us. I ask you to extend your support to me in this endeavour.I will fulfill my duty towards our nation.That is my promise to you.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe has been the target of escalated insults, jibes, taunts and .invectives after being appointed premier. These attacks are nothing new to him. It \u201cgoes with the territory\u201d from the time Ranil gained a certain stature in politics. However very few of these attacks are about his ability to repair and revive the economy. Even his vilest critics would grudgingly acknowledge that if anyone could pull Sri Lanka out of the economic morass it has sunk into, it is Ranil. Indeed that is Wickremesinghe\u2019s unique selling point!",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s flair for providing political leadership for economic revival is point that this column has emphsised in the past. \u201cRanil Wickremesinghe, the UNP Leadership and the TINA Factor\u201d was the heading of an article written by me more than eight years ago. The article published in the \u201cDaily Mirror\u201dof December 20 2013, was written in the context of the political situation prevailing then.",
    "The all-powerful President Mahinda Rajapaksa was seemingly invincible at that time. The chief opposition UNP Leader Ranil Wicremesinghe was perceived by many as a \u201cserial loser\u201d who could not defeat Mahinda. There were some in the UNP who were conspiring to seize the leadership from Ranil.",
    "My article was supportive of Ranil and argued then that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d(TINA) to him\u00a0 as\u00a0 UNP leader then. I also pointed out that after the war victory euphoria faded away and issues concerning\u00a0 \u00a0Sri Lanka\u2019s economic upliftment became more important to voters, Ranil Wickremesinghe could be projected as the better choice. The following excerpts are indicative of what I wrote then.",
    "\u201cGiven the triumphalism of majoritarianism and the perceived popularity of President Rajapaksa it may seem virtually impossible that this regime could ever be defeated electorally. But then all things are impermanent and things do change. Political popularity is ephemeral.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe Rajapaksa regime has contained or diverted resentment against it by using\u00a0 the war\u00a0 victory as the opium of the masses. But the war\u00a0 ended years ago\u00a0 and it won\u2019t be able to justify its shortcomings perpetually through war victory-euphoria. There are misgivings about economic performance.\u00a0 Charges of nepotism, corruption, repression, authoritarianism, mis-governance and abuse/misuse of power against this regime proliferate.\u201d .",
    "\u201cOnce the euphoria subsides the Country will begin yearning for better economic prospects. Man does not live by victory on the war front euphoria alone but also by bread and rice and dhal and sambol. If this regime cannot deliver then people may welcome change.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is here that Ranil Wickremesinghe could score provided of course that his party would stand by him. He can be projected as the man who could perform an economic miracle. He could also be promoted as the man who would usher in true national unity and unify its people.\u201d",
    "\u201cWickremesinghe is basically a technocrat and if elected to office would run a smooth and efficient administration. He has a firm grasp of economics and will be the best man to lead the Country on the road to economic emancipation.\u201d",
    "What I wrote then about Ranil being the ideal choice to\u00a0 spearhead\u00a0 efforts for the country\u2019s economic upliftment has come true now. He has not been elected and is a solitary UNP parliamentarian. Yet he has now donned the leadership mantle in the mission of economic recovery. Ranil like Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Grusha is now carrying the baby across facing fearful odds. Bravo Ranil!",
    "Ranil\u00a0 Wicremesinghe\u00a0 was part of the\u00a0 Junius Richard Jayewardene led\u00a0 \u201cgreen elephant\u201d\u00a0 juggernaut\u00a0 that swept the general elections of July 21st 1977\u00a0 winning 141 of the 168 seats then in Parliament. He has been in Parliament continuously since then as an MP except for a short break from August 2020 to June 2021.\u00a0 It is an indicator of Ranil\u2019remarkable resilience. No other MP in the present Parliament has as much seniority as\u00a0 Ranil. Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Mahinda\u00a0 Rajapaksa were elected to Parliament before Ranil in 1970. But they\u00a0 both lost in 1977 and were not in Parliament for many years.\u00a0 Rajavarothayam Sampanthan entered Parliament along with Ranil in 1977 but he too suffered breaks in between. Also Sampanthan forfeited his seat in 1983 after refusing to take an oath under the sixth Constitutional Amendment.",
    "The 1977 poll was the last parliamentary election conducted under the old first past the post winner system. Ranil himself contested and won the newly created Biyagama constituency with a majority of 6769 votes.He polled 22,045. H.A.David Hapangama of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) came second with 15,276 votes.Biyagama was carved out of the\u00a0 Kelaniya and Mahara electorates in the demarcation of 1976. Ranil\u2019s baptism in politics was as the UNP organizer for Kelaniya in 1975. However when Biyagama electorate came into being , he shifted to the new constituency.",
    "Forty years is a long time in politics. Wickremesinghe reached a significant milepost in his political journey in 2017\u00a0 when he completed four decades\u00a0 of being in Parliament continuously. Starting from 1977, Ranil has weathered parliamentary electoral storms in 1989, 1994, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2015 . In 1989 he won from the Gampaha electoral district under the new proportional representation system.Thereafter he was elected to Parliament from Colombo district topping the preference votes among the UNP list of candidates until 2020. Ranil tasted defeat for the first time in 2020/ The UNP was trounced at the August 2020 poll. None of its candidates were elected including leader Wickremesinghe. But the party was entitled to one nominated MP on the national list. Thus Ranil re-entered\u00a0 Parliament as a nominated MP in\u00a0 June 2021 and has been\u00a0 for many months\u00a0 the \u201clone\u00a0 elephant\u201din Parliament.",
    "Ranil was sworn in as the new Prime Minister for the sixth time last week. This is a record. Dudley Senanyake was sworn in as PM four times. In the case of Ranil he has only been a premier of short terms.\u00a0 He first became Prime Minister in May 1994 after\u00a0 President Ranasinghe\u00a0 Premadasa was assassinated by the LTTE.Premier DB Wijetunge became President and Ranil succeeded him as PM.He held office until August 1994. Ranil became Leader of the Opposition from 1994 to 2001.",
    "In December 2001 Ranil was elected premier and underwent political cohabitation with President Chandrika Kumaratunga. She dissolved the UNP-led Govt in 2004 and held fresh elections. The UNP was defeated at the April 2004 elections. Thereafter Ranil was leader of the opposition until 2015.\u00a0 Ranil holds the \u201crecord\u201d for being leader of the opposition for the most number of years.",
    "Maithripala Sirisena\u00a0 defected from the Rajapaksa Govt. and became the presidential candidate of a multiparty coalition headed by the UNP. Sirisena was elected president in January 2015 and appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister though the UNP had only about 50 seats in Parliament. After the August 2015 Parliamentary poll, Ranil was sworn in as Premier for the fourth time. Though the UNP did not have a clear majority, a viable Government was formed with the aid of some MP\u201ds from the SLFP.",
    "So Maithripala became President and Ranil the Prime Minister.\u00a0 Soon\u00a0 sharp differences \u2013 political as well as personal \u2013 began to emerge between both.The \u201cGood Governance\u201d Govt they ushered in lost its\u00a0 lustre gradually. In one of the worst instances of political\u00a0 double crossing, Sirisena struck a\u00a0 deal with Mahinda in October 2018 and appointed him Prime Minister replacing Ranil. After a 52 day political and legal battle Wickremesinghe was restored as Prime Minister again. He was sworn in as Prime Minister for the fifth time in December 2018.",
    "What I wrote then about Ranil being the ideal choice to spearhead efforts for the country\u2019s economic upliftment has come true now. He has not been elected and is a solitary UNP parliamentarian. Yet he has now donned the leadership mantle in the mission of economic recovery. Ranil like Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Grusha is now carrying the baby across facing fearful odds. Bravo Ranil!",
    "The Easter Sunday bomb attacks of April 21st 2019 radically transformed the political climate. Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya\u00a0 Rajapaksa spearheaded the return of Rajapaksas to power by getting elected President on a \u201cStrong man leader for national security\u201d platform. In the Parliamentary elections Sirisen saved his skin by aligning with the Rajapaksa led Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and got elected as an MP.",
    "Wickemesinghe however underwent political difficulties at the hands of his\u00a0 deputy Sajith Premadasa who formed the Samagi Jana Balavegaya(SJB). Most of the UNP MP\u2019s deserted Ranil. So did the minority party allies of the UNP. The grand old party was roundly defeated.\u00a0 at the 2020 election. None of its candidates were elected including leader Wickremesinghe. But the party was entitled to one seat on the national list and Ranil reentered parliament as a nominated MP in June 2021. The lone UNP Parliamentarian was sworn in a year later as Prime Miniser for the sixth time on May 12th 2022.",
    "Despite his lengthy political career, Ranil has never been elected President.\u00a0 However it must not be forgotten\u00a0 that the Presidency was lost by Ranil twice due to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In 1999 the abortive assassination attempt by the tigers on Chandrika Kumaratunge injured her. She lost an eye. This helped her win by riding the sympathy wave. In 2005 the LTTE prevented Tamils from voting through an enforced boycott. This reduced Wickremesinghe\u2019s potential votes resulting in a narrow margin of defeat. It later became known that Mahinda Rajapaksa had struck a deal with the LTTE in regard to the boycott.",
    "In 2010 and 2015 Ranil\u00a0 did not contest the presidential elections . He stood down\u00a0 in favour of Sarath Fonseka and Maithripala Sirisena respectively. In 2019 after protracted political wrangling, Ranil\u00a0 let the UNP deputy leader Sajith Premadasa contest\u00a0 the presidential elections. Currently there is much speculation that Ranil Wickremesinghe could become President after a dignified exit by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. That seems a remote possibility at this point of time. However as Doris Day sang in \u201cThe man who knew too much\u201d movie- \u201cQue Sera, Sera, Whatever will be, will be\u201d.",
    "Let me conclude the first part of this article on a personal note. I entered journalism as a trainee reporter on the Tamil daily \u201cVirakesari\u201d in 1977 the\u00a0 same year that Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 entered Parliament. My first chance of speaking to Ranil for the first time was after the 77 poll. I uttered just one word and he responded with two words. What happened then was this.",
    "When Ranil Wickremesinghe won for the first time in 1977 there was a lot of excitement among the old hands at \u201cVirakesari\u201d. This was because Ranil\u2019s father Esmond Wickremesinghe had been the chairman of a group of newspapers to which the \u201cVirakesari\u201d also belonged for some years in the late sixties and early seventies of the 20th century. Later Esmond pulled out and the \u201cVirakesari\u201d came under the re-structured Express Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.",
    "Some of the old timers at \u201cVirakesari\u201d like veteran photographer Rodrigo would keep referring to Esmond as \u201cchairman\u201d though Industrialist A.Y. S. Gnanam was the Express newspapers chairman in 1977. One morning after results were announced, Rodrigo was on the phone\u00a0 talking to someone. When I passed by, Rodrigo thrust the phone into my hands and said \u201cchairman\u2019s son\u00a0 Ranil has won. Congratulate him\u201d. So I simply said one word \u201cCongratulations\u201d!. He replied \u201cThank You\u201d.That was all. I handed the phone back to Rodrigo.",
    "I never got the chance to interact with Ranil Wickremesinghe in my professional capacity as a journalist during the years I was in Sri Lanka. It so happened that the news rounds I covered never brought me into Ranil\u2019s orbit. I did not cover ministries under Wickremesinghe in those days and never got the chance to talk to him.",
    "Even in terms of gathering political news and inside stories,, Ranil Wickremesinghe\u00a0 was not one of my\u00a0 ministerial sources in the JRJ cabinet. I relied on ministers like Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, Anandatissa de Alwis, E.L. Senanayake, Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman, A. C. S. Hameed, K. W. Devanayagam ,,Gamani Jayasuriya and Festus Perera for that.",
    "In my case the only occasion I interacted with Wickremesinghe \u201csocially\u201d was in 1985 during the time of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s visit to Sri Lanka. Former \u201cSunday Leader\u201d editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and I were working at \u201cThe Island\u201d at that time and were in Kandy to cover her visit.",
    "Ranil Wickremesinghe, Education and Youth Affairs minister at that time invited us for dinner. I found him to be a genial conversationalist and amiable personality. He was well-read and well-informed. Though I cannot remember the details of he conversation now, I do recall being immensely impressed by his knowledge of men and matters.",
    "We joked much and laughed lot. I remember that when the band came around, Ranil picked \u201cKandy Lamissi\u201d by Mariazelle, to be played. He was a bachelor then and we teased him about who his \u201cmenike\u201d was. He took it good-humouredly. It was a very pleasant evening.",
    "I left Sri Lanka in 1988. While writing to \u201cThe Sundy Leader\u201d from Canada I got to know about Ranil\u2019s views on certain issues- like the Oslo-facilitated peace process - through Lasantha. I did not interact with Ranil directly.",
    "In Dec 2013 I wrote an article in the \u201cDaily Miror\u201d that I have referred to in this article earlier. Ranil telephoned me from Colombo and thanked me for it. In 2014 , I wrote an article titled \u201cLTTE-enforced boycott lost Ranil the presidency in 2005\u201d.It was published in the \u201cDaily Mirror\u201d of October 24th 2014.Again the UNP Leader Wickremesinghe\u00a0 telephoned me directly and thanked me.",
    "In that article I had explained in detail about how and why the LTTE wanted\u00a0 Ranil\u2019s defeat. I later heard from UNP sources that copies of the article had been distributed widely at \u201cSrikotha\u201d then. I was also told that Ranil Wickremesinghe had mentioned my name and the article at a public meeting.\u00a0 He reportedly told the audience to read DBS Jeyaraj\u2019s article to know the truth about the 2005 Presidential election."
