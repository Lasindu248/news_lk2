    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Chairman of the\u00a0Foundation for the Protection of Public Rights, Asela Sampath has demanded as to why the people are standing in queues to purchase essential goods at Sathosa outlets if they were imported from Myanmar and India.",
    "Speaking at a press conference held today (10), Sampath also pointed out that people are unable to purchase the food pack for Rs. 1950/- despite a program being launched to ensure that there are enough necessities.",
    "He further questioned whether the Government launched the program to enable people to purchase a Sathosa food pack after ensuring that the goods are available.",
    "Therefore, he alleged that it seems that several ministry officials and those in senior positions have sold the imported items, akin to the garlic scam.",
    "\u201d\u00a0People don\u2019t have to stay in queue at Sathosa stores if there is rice from India. Where are the 40,000 metric tonnes of rice received from India? Where is the rice imported from Myanmar?\u201d he demanded.",
