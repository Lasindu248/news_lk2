    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has spent 990 million US dollars of reserves for imports from October 2022, though interventions reduced in February 2022, official data showed, leading to a rapid deterioration of remaining reserves which has ended in a float.",
    "Imports soared in the last quarter of 2022 as interventions were made and the money was printed to enforce a policy rate.",
    "Sri Lanka net interventions have reduced in February 2022 to 23 million US dollars in February 2022, with 185.34 million US dollars sold and 162.34 million dollars bought via a surrender requirement, data from the state debt office showed.",
    "From October when interventions began, net reserves given for imports have totaled 990 million US dollars.",
    "The central bank is buying dollars under a surrender requirement, despite the peg being under pressure.",
    "A float ends interventions and the requirement to print money to maintain policy rates allowing inflows to match outflows. However a surrender requirement is a hurdle for a floating regime to become established, analysts have warned.",
    "Economist W A Wijewardene, the IMF and oher analysts have called for rate hikes to end money printing and make the float to work,",
    "If the float fails to take place, all the economic problems that took place at 203 will take place at the lower level.",
    "The rupee has fallen to 275 to the US dollar but forex shortages still persist. Data also showed more money has been printed. (Colombo/Mar21/2022)"
