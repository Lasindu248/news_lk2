  "title": "Russia, Ukraine set for face-to-face peace talks",
  "body_lines": [
    "Russian and Ukrainian negotiators will resume face-to-face peace talks as soon as Monday, probing whether a near-stalemate in fighting has forced Moscow to temper its demands.",
    "President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the new negotiations, saying he hoped they would bring peace \u201cwithout delay\u201d, and lamented a month-long Russian attack that has already killed thousands and devastated numerous Ukrainian cities.",
    "The new talks are set to start in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday, with Zelensky desperate to halt the bombardment of cities like Mariupol, where officials said the situation is \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.",
    "About 170,000 civilians remain trapped in Mariupol without adequate food, water or medicine, as the southern port city is being turned \u201cinto dust\u201d by Russian shelling, according to Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry.",
    "France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a \u201chumanitarian operation\u201d to evacuate civilians within days, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has sought an OK from Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.",
    "Several previous rounds of peace talks have failed to halt the fighting or overcome fundamental disagreements about Kyiv\u2019s alignment with the West and Russia\u2019s occupation of Ukrainian territory.",
    "But with Russia\u2019s much-larger military humbled by fierce Ukrainian resistance and forced to abandon efforts to capture Kyiv, there is renewed hope for talks.",
    "\u201cOur goal is obvious \u2014 peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,\u201d Zelensky said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines.",
    "\u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,\u201d he said.",
    "Zelensky has previously indicated he is \u201ccarefully\u201d considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian \u201cneutrality\u201d.",
    "\u201cThis point of the negotiations is understandable to me and it is being discussed, it is being carefully studied,\u201d Zelensky said during an interview with several independent Russian news organisations.",
    "Putin has avoided being precise about the goals of his attack, stating only that he wanted to \u201cdemilitarise and denazify\u201d but not occupy Ukraine.",
    "Commentators hope that vagueness will now give him more room to accept an agreement, claim victory and end the war.",
    "The UN estimates that at least 1,100 civilians have died and more than 10 million have been displaced in a devastating war that has gone on far longer than Moscow expected."
