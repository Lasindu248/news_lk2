    "\u201cThe U.S. is committed to supporting the Sri Lankan people as they face today\u2019s economic and political challenges,\u201d said Julie Chung, U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka. \u201cAs a longstanding development partner, we will continue to champion efforts that promote sustainable economic growth and good governance.\u201d",
