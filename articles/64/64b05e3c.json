  "title": "Sri Lanka requests fuel price formulae from supplies to minimise losses: energy minister",
  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Price revisions have not reduced losses for Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Ceypetco) and price formulae have been requested from two main fuel suppliers in order to minimise losses, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara said.",
    "Lanka IOC, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) unit in Sri Lanka, raised petrol prices by 35 rupees to 338 rupees a litre and diesel by 75 rupees to 289 rupees a litre from midnight April 18 amid sharp depreciation of the currency and high global oil prices.",
    "On April 19, Ceypetco raised petrol to 338 rupees a litre and auto diesel to 289 rupees a litre saying it suffered big losses due to a collapse of the rupee and higher global prices.",
    "Minister Wijesekara told parliament on Thursday (05) that Ceypetco is still making losses due to fuel being sold at a lower price than the purchase price.",
    "\u201cBefore the revisions, Ceypetco\u2019s daily loss due to the difference between purchasing price and selling price was 1,613 million rupees. This is because from a long time we were selling fuel to the general public at a lower price than the purchasing price,\u201d Wijesekara said.",
    "On Thursday, the international price of Brent Crude oil was around 11 US dollars while the WTI crude prices traded around 108.55 US dollars.",
    "\u201cWe have been selling petrol, diesel and even kerosene at subsidized prices for a long time,\u201d Wijesekara said.",
    "\u201cEven after the price revisions, it has not yet become profitable, because the government is still providing subsidising fuel.\u201d",
    "Wijesekara said kerosene is still being sold for 87 rupees a litre though purchasing price remains 313 rupees.",
    "\u201cBecause the fishing community and low income families are heavily dependent on this fuel, we are maintaining that price. It is same for both petrol and diesel prices as well,\u201d he said.",
    "The minister said the rapid depreciation of the rupee is another reason for the continuous losses incurred by the state-owned firm.",
    "\u201cWe made the revisions when the rupee was at 330 against the US dollar and now it has gone to up 360 rupees.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee was offered at 370 to the US dollar for telegraphic transfers for small transactions while larger deals went at higher rates near 380 to the US dollar.",
    "Wijesekara said the cabinet of ministers has requested both Ceypetco and Lanka IOC to propose price formulas to minimise losses for the state.",
    "\u201cWe believe that by next week, both Ceypetco and IOC will give the cabinet a price formula to settle this situation. Not to specifically to make profit but to minimise the loss so we can raise funds for the next shipment,\u201d said Wijesekara.",
    "He added that the purchasing prices of fuel per month increased up to 580 million US dollars in May and in the coming month, around 550 million US dollars per month will be needed to continue to Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel supply without interruption.",
    "Sri Lanka has already used 400 million US dollars from a 500 million US dollar credit line received from India to purchase fuel.",
    "On May 02, India extended its fuel credit line to Sri Lanka by another 200 million US dollars which will enable the island nation to import another four fuel shipments while a further 500 million US dollar credit line is also under discussion.",
    "\u201cWe have around 100 million US dollars from the earlier credit line with which we will bring fuel to the country within this month. We will also bring in more fuel with the 200 million US dollar extended credit line,\u201d said Wijesekara.",
    "He said, however, with the credit line, both crude and furnace oil cannot be imported and, therefore, the government is looking at several other suppliers to get supplies.",
    "\u201cWe held \u00a0discussions with multiple parties including Russia as well, and the discussions are continuing,\u201d he said.",
    "Closing the Sapugaskanda refinery during the former power and Energy minister\u2019s time was a historic mistake, the minister further said.",
    "\u201cWe had to spend more money to purchase fuel because of this. That was a wrong decision. We will restart it soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
    "Wijesekara told parliament that enough petrol stocks to meet market demand is available in the country and within the next three days, queues that formed due to the protest of private fuel transporters will be back to normal.",
    "\u201cBut we have some issues with diesel, and it is not a question of our stock being not enough,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAfter the Norochcholai power plant\u2019s breakdown Sunday evening, we lost 275MW of power to the main grid. We had to take a decision on whether to issue fuel to filling stations or to the power houses to keep the power cuts within three hours and 30 minutes.\u201d",
    "If the stocks are not being allocated to power plants, Wijesekara said, the current power cuts that are limited to three hours and 20 minutes will be extended to six to seven hours a day. To prevent this, he said, a decision was taken to issue a majority of the diesel stock to the power plants.",
    "\u201cWe normally issue 4,000 metric tons of diesel to the market, but under the current circumstances we can only issue 1,000-1,500 MT,\u201d said the minister.",
    "\u201cThe next diesel ship under the Indian credit line is scheduled to arrive on May 11. I ask the public not to stock diesel. We have limited stocks and we are managing it to a certain level to keep the power cuts limited to the three hour and 20 minute,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May05/2022)"
