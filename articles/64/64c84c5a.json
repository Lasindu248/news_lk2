    "COLOMBO (News 1st);\u00a0The Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government has instructed the Heads of Institutions that there is no need for non-essential public servants to report for duty tomorrow (20) except those officers who are required to perform essential services.",
    "This was mentioned in a circular issued by the Secretary to the Ministry J.J. Ratnasiri, while Prime Minister previously in Parliament\u00a0requested public servants who do not belong to essential services to refrain from reporting to work on Friday (20), given the shortage of fuel that exists in the country.",
    "However, the circular states that this decision should not interfere with the discretion of the head of the institution regarding the recruitment of officers for urgent and essential duties.",
    "Friday (20) declared a holiday for State & State-approved private schools"
