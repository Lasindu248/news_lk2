    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Diplomats of key western nations, the US and Japan have called on Sri Lanka to join them in \u2018vocal support\u2019 of Ukraine as the country resisted an invasion by Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
    "\u201cAs Heads of Mission to Sri Lanka, we urge the Government of Sri Lanka to join us in vocal support for Ukraine and international law, including the UN Charter,\u201d heads mission of key Western nations, the US and Japan said in a statement.",
    "\u201cWe urge Sri Lanka to join us in calling on Russia to end its hostilities immediately.",
    "\u201cWe will work together with our friends and allies around the world to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored. We stand with Ukraine; and for freedom, democracy, and the sovereignty of nations around the world.\u201d",
    "Western European nations have banded together with the US to help Ukraine which has been caught up in a Pan-Russian expansionist project of the current Russian president Putin.",
    "Russia has shown signs of becoming bogged down in Ukraine with supply lines cut and her tanks, armoured personnel carriers and also aircraft being steadily destroyed by determined Ukrainian fighters.",
    "Russia had also brought in Syrian mercenaries and has clamped down on the media domestically and is arresting anti-war protestors.",
    "Among those who signed the call to end the invasion of Ukraine was Italy, which sided with Hitler in his pan-German third Reich project in World War II while under fascist rule.",
    "Romania, which was also with Hitler has signed the call. Western European nations are engaged in a centuries-old effort to stop the war in their region starting from the treaty of Westphalia.",
    "The League of Nations and its successor the United Nations was also primarily set up to stop wars in Europe as well as generally stop nationalism by liberal thinkers.",
    "The EU is also a project to stop economic nationalism and promote free trade which generally tends to stop wars from starting.",
    "Ukraine has been fiercely resisting Russian ground troops and armor, using Javelin and NLAW anti-tank weapons. A number of aircraft and helicopters have also been shot down by anti-aircraft defences, surprising outsiders.",
    "As of March 18, the Ukraine military claimed to have destroyed or captured 450 tanks, 1,448 armoured cars, 205 artillery systems, 72 multiple rocket launchers, 879 trucks/cars and 43 anti-aircraft systems, 93 aircraft and 112 helicopters.",
    "COLOMBO, 18 March 2022\u2500We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia\u2019s unprovoked, unjust and illegal invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign and democratic state. This outrageous attack is a gross violation of international law, including the UN charter.",
    "The world has watched in horror as Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has caused a catastrophic humanitarian toll. Russia has dramatically escalated its attacks on civilian neighbourhoods and infrastructure, leading to large numbers of civilian casualties. Millions of ordinary civilians \u2013 mainly women, children and older persons \u2013 have been forced to flee from their homes into neighbouring countries as refugees, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the last 70 years.",
    "Russia\u2019s invasion is an unprovoked and unlawful attack on a peaceful country. Russia threatens the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that underpin peace and security around the world. We give our full backing to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres\u2019 statement that",
    "\u201cThe UN Charter has been challenged in the past, but it has stood firm on the side of peace, security, development, justice, international law, and human rights.  The international community must do everything in its power so that these values prevail in Ukraine and for all humanity.\u201d",
    "Russia is isolated in the face of overwhelming support for Ukraine.",
    "We stand united in condemnation of the Russian government\u2019s attacks on Ukraine.  In the UN General Assembly on 2 March, 141 countries \u2013 an overwhelming majority \u2013 voted to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion. This demonstrates Russia\u2019s utmost isolation from the international community. Countries supporting Ukraine have imposed an unprecedented package of targeted sanctions to inflict heavy cost on Russia. These aim to degrade Russia\u2019s capacity to pursue its attacks against Ukraine, and to press Russia to withdraw from hostilities.  We have seen organisations from banks to oil companies, to football leagues, make it clear that Putin\u2019s actions have consequences and his regime can no longer be part of the international community.",
    "Friends and allies of Ukraine have committed significant levels of economic and humanitarian assistance with many countries opening their boarders to Ukrainian families fleeing the war.",
    "Russia is promoting false narratives as a pretext for invasion.",
    "The Russian government has conducted an aggressive disinformation campaign against Ukraine in a spurious attempt to justify its invasion. There is no justification for Russia\u2019s campaign to subvert its democratic neighbours. Russia falsely accuses NATO of provocation. NATO is, and always has been, a defensive alliance, and poses no threat to Russia.",
    "Calling on Sri Lanka to join in active support for Ukraine and international peace and security",
    "As Heads of Mission to Sri Lanka, we urge the Government of Sri Lanka to join us in vocal support for Ukraine and international law, including the UN Charter. We urge Sri Lanka to join us in calling on Russia to end its hostilities immediately.",
    "We will work together with our friends and allies around the world to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored. We stand with Ukraine; and for freedom, democracy, and the sovereignty of nations around the world.",
    "Signed by the following Ambassadors and High Commissioners to Sri Lanka (in alphabetical order of missions):",

    "H.E. Ms. Sarah Hulton, High Commissioner of the United Kingdom",
