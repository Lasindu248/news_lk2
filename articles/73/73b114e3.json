  "body_lines": [
    "The government has decided to increase train fares shortly to cover the cost of fuel and not to earn a profit, Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said.",
    "Addressing the weekly post cabinet news briefing today, he noted that the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) runs at a massive loss, in addition to a huge debt owed to CEYPETCO.",
    "\"You all must understand that the SLR cannot provide an efficient service to the public while incurring an unbearable loss like this and becoming a liability to the Treasury. Therefore, the SLR will have to increase train fares, though reluctantly, sooner rather than later, at least to minimize the losses. My target is to bring the SLR to a break-even level, \" Minister Amunugama said.",
    "The SLR is in the process of preparing a train fare formula right now and will impose new train fares after cabinet approval. (Sandun Jayasekera)"
