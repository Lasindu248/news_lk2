    "(AP) \u2014 The State Department says it\u2019s paying more than $2 million per month to provide 24-hour security to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a former top aide, both of whom face \u201cserious and credible\u201d threats from Iran.",
    "The department told Congress in a report that the cost of protecting Pompeo and former Iran envoy Brian Hook between August 2021 and February 2022 amounted to $13.1 million.",
    "Pompeo and Hook led the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran and the report says U.S. intelligence assesses that the threats to them have remained constant since they left government and could intensify.",
    "The threats have persisted even as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has been engaged in indirect negotiations with Iran over a U.S. return to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal.",
    "As a former secretary of state, Pompeo was automatically given 180 days of protection by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security after leaving office.",
    "But that protection has been repeatedly extended in 60-day increments by Secretary of State Antony Blinken due to \u201ca serious and credible threat from a foreign power or agent of a foreign power arising from duties performed by former Secretary Pompeo while employed by the department,\u201d the report said.",
