    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Hundreds of Sri Lankans this week demanded the cancellation of a 500 million US dollar wind power deal with India\u2019s Adani group due to possible corruption as the project was not opened for competitive bidding.",
    "The protest was held for over three hours starting near a shopping mall \u2013\u00a0 the Majestic City, in the capital Colombo and then moved to the Power and Energy Ministry and Indian High Commission premises in the neighbourhood.",
    "Adani Group, a multinational diversified conglomerate which has business interests ranging from port management to power generation and renewable energy to natural gas, was awarded the deal in 2021 to generate 500 MW of power using wind mills in the island nation\u2019s northern coast.",
    "The project was resisted by some trade unions at the state-run utility provider Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and activists groups claim that the project has bypassed normal tender procedures and was clandestinely signed between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s government and the owner of the Adani group who is a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
    "\u201cWe are for renewable energy, but we are against shady deals, non-transparency and lack of accountability,\u201d Amanda Wanduragala, a youth protester told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cThis tender should have been given to the lowest bidder, so Adani shouldn\u2019t get it.",
    "\u201cThis deal will not be beneficial to us, simply because we can\u2019t give Adani power over our energy sector, and because this is turning into a monopoly. Our country is already suffering and we can\u2019t afford to sell ourselves even more to India,\u201d she said.",
    "Many of the youth came from the group that has been protesting for the last 75 days demanding that President Rajapaksa resign, participants told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cWe are here to tell Adani that although we want renewable energy and although the country needs foreign direct investment (FDI) in order to get through the crisis, we don\u2019t want Adani,\u201d another protester told EconomyNext asking not to be named.",
    "\u201cThe way out of this crisis is not more corrupt deals through the backdoor. We want to tell [Rajapasa] and Modi not to push non-transparent deals. The law of this country has been [sidestepped] to push through the wind project.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is facing one of its worst economic crises in history, and India has helped with over 3 billion US dollars in credit lines and by delaying the island nation\u2019s import payments.",
    "Some of the protesters said that India should not use Sri Lanka\u2019s vulnerable position to take advantage in business deals.",
    "Melanie Gunathilake, a 26-year old protester, said they were against the allegedly corrupt deal signed by the Rajapaksa government and Adani Power supported by the Modi government.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka definitely needs renewable energy, and we want to move to a sustainable future but that shouldn\u2019t happen through a corrupt deal,\u201d she said.",
    "The protest comes amid a cold war between India and China in the island nation for strategic infrastructure projects. It was also held nearly a week after the government amended the Sri Lanka Electricity Act to entertain unsolicited projects, replacing the earlier competitive bidding process.",
    "In early 2021, aggressive trade union protests against leasing a Colombo Port terminal to India and Japan forced the government to reverse that deal. However, the Rajapaksa government later compromised with India and gave another 800 million US dollar longer terminal deal to\u00a0 theAdani group last year.",
    "India has raised security concerns over increasing Chinese influence in Sri Lanka as many infrastructure projects are given to China financed by Beijing.",
    "China was chosen to handle renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern islands through the standard tender process, but the Sri Lanka government later cancelled them after India protested against China coming close to its southern boarder. (Colombo/Jun16/2022)"
