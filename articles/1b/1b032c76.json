    "Sri Lanka Economic Association (SLEA), the premier professional organisation of economists in the Island being a centre of excellence in economic policy discourse for nearly four decades is an independent economic think-tank. SLEA has made it possible to identify and fill a gap in the flow of economic ideas and knowledge.",
    "SLEA has conducted an online program for six months commencing from February 2021 to quench the thirst among upcoming management leaders for earning a well-recognised Diploma. The unique program was named as Professional Diploma in Economics for Business (PDEB). The entire program was conducted in a very conducive, student-centred environment giving the opportunity to interact with the top economists in the country.",
    "Resource pool consisted of personnel from several Universities, corporate sector, public sector representing a mixture of Academia and practitioners and a gamut of branches of economics. The program commenced with a module on \u2018Introduction to Business Economics\u2019 and ran through 13 modules ending up with \u2018Career Planning and Leaning Portfolio Development\u2019 covering all aspects of Business and Management in small, medium and large-scale enterprises and in all economic sectors.",
    "The program helps those who work in both private and public sectors with varying levels of exposure to economics as well as those who have not had substantive training in economics but require its analytic tools as part of their business skills. It also provides the foundations for further studies in economics.",
    "In designing the course, the main objective was not merely to create and deliver knowledge but also to equip the participants with the ability to apply, analyse economic phenomena and instil higher order thinking through introduction of a professional diploma to cater to a diverse group.",
    "The pioneer PDEB program commenced in February 2021 and ran over a period of six months.\u00a0 A total of 47 candidates registered for the program and 38 candidates successfully completed all course work, examination and assignments. Certificate Awarding Ceremony was held on Saturday 9 April at Western Province Aesthetic Resort, Colombo 07. The grand event marked the culmination of this training Program.",
    "Rev. Professor. W. Wimalaratana, the President of SLEA and of the Department of Economics, University of Colombo welcomed the participants. He emphasised the mandate and the contribution of SLEA being the only professional body for Sri Lankan economists set up in the year 1985 and incorporated in 2011 by an Act of Parliament.",
    "The Chief Guest Dr. Upananda Vidanapathirana, stated that this event marks an important milestone in the evolution of the SLEA because it marks the first time the Association has stepped into educational programs, which is one of the Association\u2019s key objectives as stated in the incorporated Act. The Guest of Honour Senior Prof. Udith Jayasinghe expressed his gratitude to SLEA for conducting a program of this nature which filled a long-awaited need in knowledge building among the business managers and congratulated those who leave with a well-recognised Diploma Certificate in hand.",
    "Course Director Dr. Menuka Udugama mentioned a wide range of candidates from undergraduates, masters holders to professionals have earned this diploma with a lot of effort. \u201cIt\u2019s really a great moment to see almost all of you here after one year since the inception,\u201d she added. Vice President Chandrasena Maliyadde delivered the votes of thanks.",
