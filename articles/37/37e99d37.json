    "\u201cThat is why, being an entrepreneur myself, I fully understand how important forums such as these are to provide support for the next generation of female leaders, and the Board of AmCham feels immense happiness to be a part of someone\u2019s dream by encouraging women to showcase their entrepreneurial skills,\u201d she shared."
