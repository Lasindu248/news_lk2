    "Eastern Province (EP) Governor Anuradha Yahampath yesterday ordered to set up a home garden in every government institution that comes under the Eastern Provincial Council.",
    "She instructed the Agriculture Provincial Ministry Secretary to coordinate the plan with the intervention of the Provincial Ministry of Agriculture.",
    "She said this while addressing a special meeting with the Batticaloa District Agriculture Instructors.",
    "Governor Yahampath also called on the Agriculture Instructors to educate the farmers and create a cultivation battle to face the forthcoming food crisis.",
    "\"We are talking about food shortages in the future. To counter that situation, it is necessary to start short-term crop cultivation as soon as we can. Everyone should treat this as their responsibility,\" she said.",
    "If there is a food crisis and people are put to suffering, the responsibility has to be shouldered by the agricultural consultants for their failure to guide the farming community, the Governor said.",
    "\"The next battle stares us is cultivating the lands. Farmers should be provided with adequate facilities. The relationship between the government and the farmer is what the agricultural advisors need to understand and work to tackle the food crisis that appears imminent, \u201dshe added."
