    "The Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday invited professionals to join hands and play a proactive role with SJB to build a sound policy platform to make Sri Lanka prosperous.",
    "He made this invitation as the Chief Guest at the \u201cForward, Together for the Nation\u201d forum organised by the National Council of Professionals at the BMICH.",
    "\u201cEveryone has to unite, mobilise our energies and capacities and make a strong determination to extricate our motherland from this quagmire,\u201d said Preamadasa. He blamed the economic catastrophe on the hero-worshipping, refusal to listen to professional advice and knee jerk reactions by the Rajapaksa administration."
