    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Laka\u2019s state-run Litro Gas Lanka Ltd Chairman Vijitha Herath resigned from the position Friday (10) afternoon after a stint of little under two months.",
    "Herath was appointed in April, a week after previous Chairman Theshara Jayasinghe resigned resigned blaming ex-ministers and the administration for the country\u2019s economic crisis.",
    "The reasons for Herath\u2019s departure were not immediately clear. Delays in cooking gas distribution has caused much public inconvenience, with long queues for gas cylinders still a common sight, particularly outside of Colombo.",
    "Litro was the sole cooking gas provider in the island from early this year when the privately owned Laugfs Gas was left unable to import gas due to dollar shortages making it difficult for the company to open letters of credit.",
    "The forex crunch hit Litro from mid-May, leaving the company unable to distribute cooking gas for short periods of time. The company issued distribution plans and urged the public not to queue up for fuel.",
    "Herath had previously served as chairman of Sri Lanka Insurance and the Ceylon Electricity Board. (Colombo/Jun10/22)"
