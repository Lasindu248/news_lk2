    "The Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) in its strongest possible terms had condemned the attack on peaceful protestors at Galle Face by a group of politically motivated unruly people.",
    "\u201cThis attack no doubt would further deteriorate the already beleaguered business environment especially MSME\u2019s in the country,\u201d FCCISL said in a statement.",
    "\u201cWe request the appropriate authorities to take legal action against attackers and masterminds who motivated them in order to create a peaceful environment for the people of the country to exercise their fundamental rights,\u201d it said.",
    "The statement also said: The incident has already received wide coverage on worldwide media making an irreparable loss on the country\u2019s image. We regret that this attack took place at a time when the country needs a boost to its economy and social security etc.",
    "We also regret that law enforcement authorities failed to take adequate\u00a0 \u00a0measures to prevent the attack, which caused injuries to nearly 200 people and sparked violent activities, which led to loss of lives and property in some parts of the country. At this critical juncture FCCISL appeals to people to be calm and desist from violence.",
