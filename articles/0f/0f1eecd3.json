Driving the true spirit of sustainability, SLT-MOBITEL understands the intrinsic importance of a greener earth, the direct benefits of healthy plants on human health and wellbeing and the need to restore nature, halting and reversing climate change to sustain humanity for generations to come.",
    "Launched under the theme \u2018Let\u2019s nourish the country with clean air and fertilizer\u2019, it brings into focus the critical importance of preserving eco-fragility for collective well-being.The \u2018Mee\u2019 tree was chosen considering its contribution to pest control, ability to be used in the production of organic fertilizer, capacity to purify air and its use as a medicinal plant. To-date SLT-MOBITEL has distributed and planted over 1000 trees across several locations, including Monaragala, Umandawa, Anuradhapura and Kandy.",

The Mee Tree drive, in addition to improving air quality and mitigating climate change also promotes better pest control, healthier soil and aims to enhance natural humidity. A notable feature of the programme is governance through KPIs, including geo tagging plants and their ownership. Using modern technology, the \u2018THURU\u2019 mobile application is used to monitor the progress of the project.Broadening its environmental stewardship, SLT-MOBITEL also engages in other initiatives such as e-Waste reduction and minimising its carbon footprint.
