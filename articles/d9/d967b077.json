    "The Sunday Island of May 29, 2022 has interesting articles reflecting the varied points of view of professionals and concerned citizens on our current and very grave\u00a0economic and political crisis. Rajan Phillips and Keith Noyar reflect\u00a0on the gap between what we know are the demands of street protests in the \u201cAragalaya\u201d, and the responses of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government.",
    "The Aragalaya protestors on the street are not convinced that Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe joining a cabinet of mostly the same old Ministers whom they hold accountable\u00a0with the President\u00a0for the country\u2019s\u00a0crisis, has transformed it into the\u00a0 \u201cnew \u201d or \u201cinterim\u201d government they are demanding. Gnana Moonesinghe approves of what she sees as the \u201cnew\u201d governance, and the Ranil Wickremesinghe headed \u201cnew\u00a0 cabinet.\u201d She has confidence in the leadership role that Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has assumed. She thinks he should be supported to accomplish\u00a0this task.",
    "These differing viewpoints\u00a0reflect a deeper reality. And this is the polarized approaches to governance in our country. The Aragalaya demands embody a viewpoint that we as citizens have ignored for many decades- the importance of the accountability\u00a0of those\u00a0who hold public office to the nation for corruption,\u00a0 gross financial mismanagement and abuse of public and political\u00a0 office.\u00a0 They challenge the right of a government that has created what has been described as \u201cthe most man made\u00a0and voluntary economic crisis\u201d (Rajan Philips citing Mick Moore Asian Development Bank Consultant) to continue in office.",
    "They are not willing to forgive and forget, as most of us have done for decades. The recent revelations in a Parliamentary review of the Central Bank\u2019s work from 2020 reinforces the culpability of the President and his officials and the institutional failures that make our predicament a \u201cman-made crisis\u201d. The even more shocking report of the Inspector General of Police on the deeply politicized appointments to this vital institution in law enforcement support the strident cry from the street for what they describe as \u201csystemic and institutional change\u201d. They may not articulate how this can be done. But who can question the legitimacy\u00a0of that strident demand for accountable governance for the well-being of the People who elected\u00a0 a government to office?",
    "What we as citizens\u00a0should ask ourselves is whether a country which has such polarized\u00a0views on governance, can create the stable political environment\u00a0that we need if we are to emerge from these dark times. Can we think of a country in which a government that has brought the nation to bankruptcy through gross financial mismanagement, created grave\u00a0 food insecurity in\u00a0 \u00a0a country, where a papaw seed thrown in\u00a0 a home\u00a0 garden can bring an abundance of fruit, through deliberate and flawed agricultural policies, is permitted to continue to hold office? And this in a situation where the IGP the\u00a0 head of the Police Service, and his officers,\u00a0 failed to afford protection against injury to person and massive damage to property, entailing\u00a0 millions\u00a0 in insurance payments. This was explained by him as the impact of extensive regular\u00a0political interference, which prevented him from building an effective law enforcement agency. The international financial agencies have given a clear message that stability must be a precondition for the kind of significant support we need to restructure our debt. Handouts from sympathetic\u00a0donors into our begging bowl facilitated by what is referred to by faithful supporters of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe as his \u201cinternational connections,\u201d will not suffice.",
    "Can we address the issues of importance and find solutions to the current crisis without\u00a0 \u00a0creating\u00a0some consensus\u00a0on linking with the aragalaya in their demand for systemic and institutional change, to address this rotten scenario?\u00a0 Can we not build consensus on the type of governance we want, to\u00a0 \u00a0help us move forward, instead of being trapped in our now familiar toxic and\u00a0 adversarial\u00a0 politics?",
    "But even that seems to be an impossibly difficult task, because of widely divergent understandings of what this country needs to initiate such changes in governance. Constitutional reform is considered the need of the hour.",
    "Minister GL Pieris is reported to have informed the diplomatic\u00a0community that the street protests are not really an anti-government\u00a0initiative, but a demand\u00a0 for \u201csystemic and institutional change\u201d. So the President himself and Mr. Wickremesinghe and the cabinet have come to the conclusion that a \u201csop\u201d in the form of a Constitutional change that they say \u201cwill reduce the powers\u00a0of the President\u201d will give us the \u201cmagical\u201d systemic and institutional\u00a0 changes that are\u00a0 being demanded in the \u201cAragalaya\u201d. Key stake holders in civil society like the Bar Association, the Peoples Movement for Social Justice, led by Mr. Karu Jayasuriya and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce all have indicated approval for this change in public statements. They seem to believe that a Constitutional Amendment to reduce the powers\u00a0of the Presidency will be the golden path to achieving stability and accountable governance.",
    "Maybe President Gotabaya Rajapaksa himself has a vision that he will realize for the nation the \u201cvistas of prosperity and splendour\u201d he promised, in this exciting new and well packaged and media\u00a0hyped transformation.\u00a0 The President has emerged from seclusion once again, to have televised meetings with his officials and his \u201cnew\u201d Minister of Agriculture. Officials as usual appeared to \u201csit in solemn silence\u201d around the table. The President instructed them with a grave expression to do the very opposite on fertilizer distribution, to what he demanded from them for the previous two years. Also, with Presidential aplomb he told them to distribute state land to the people to grow mung and cowpea instead of paddy, and encourage all citizens to cultivate food in their home gardens to avoid starvation. We can expect a gazette notification on this shortly.",
    "And so our public discourse has shifted\u00a0to a focus on the 21st Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, that the Minister of Justice will bring to Parliament for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa/Ranil Wickremesinghe government.",
    "This Amendment is based on a Bill presented as a private member\u2019s\u00a0Bill, a short while ago, when Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was in the opposition. It was in one sense a response to the Samagi Jana Balavegaya private member\u2019s Bill presented by the leader of the Opposition\u00a0Mr. Sajith Premedasa, as the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. The 21A of the Samagi Bill (21A S) seeks to ABOLISH\u00a0 the Executive\u00a0Presidency, while Mr. Rajapakshe\u2019s Bill (21A (MoJ)) RETAINS\u00a0 the institution, and aims to REDUCE the powers of the President on the lines of the 19th Amendment enacted during the\u00a0 Maithripla Sirisena/Ranil Wickremesinghe Yahapalanaya\u00a0government. Both seek to repeal the 20th Amendment brought\u00a0by the Gotabaya\u00a0Rajapaksa government\u00a0 that has been constantly\u00a0criticized for expanding the powers of the President, even beyond those given to President\u00a0JR Jayewardene in the 1978 Constitution that continues to be the basic law of the country. Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in his recent new avatar as Minister of Justice has withdrawn his private member\u2019s Bill and has the support of the Rajapaksa/Wickremesinghe government to present it with some modifications\u00a0 in Parliament as the government\u2019s initiative on Constitutional reform.",
    "Critiques ask why the government is bringing the 21A (MoJ) to merely REDUCE Presidential powers when the aragalaya as well as the Opposition support a Bill to ABOLISH\u00a0 the Presidency. They point out that the Samagi Bill (21A (S),\u00a0 has provisions (some derived from the 19th Amendment itself) to strengthen the institutions of government with the\u00a0independent\u00a0 Commissions on matters like the public service and human rights, and also to provide stronger provisions for monitoring financial management by the President and\u00a0 Executive branch of government, to help ensure\u00a0 \u00a0accountability to Parliament. Mr. Rajapakshe\u2019s government Bill (21A MoJ) also has various\u00a0provisions to strengthen the accountability of the Executive and the President to Parliament. We are told that these will be further\u00a0strengthened to incorporate changes suggested\u00a0by civil society and professional groups. So the central\u00a0difference is in regard to the approach to the Executive President\u2019s role in governance.",
    "Minister\u00a0Rajapakshe has said in public that it is dangerous to abolish the Executive Presidency in light of the electoral\u00a0 system of proportional representation. The non-articulated concern of the Minister and some of those who support his Bill, from within and outside\u00a0Parliament, is that an Executive Presidency is necessary to prevent the 13th\u00a0Amendment which devolves\u00a0powers to Provinces\u00a0being used to create a separate state for the Tamils of the country. This argument on strong national security and risks of separatism\u00a0seem to have influenced some\u00a0 civil society organizations as well, to support Mr. Rajapakshe\u2019s government Bill.",
    "The concern that we need a Presidency to prevent a separatist agenda, that seeks to divide our country, is ill founded. Article 2 of the Constitution\u00a0recognizes that Sri Lanka is a \u201cunitary state\u201d. The 13th Amendment has been enacted within the framework of that concept. There are many countries with Parliamentary democracies including\u00a0India, Canada and UK where a Prime Minister in Parliament has to do the same job regarding national security and\u00a0 \u00a0unity as are envisaged in the Presidential\u00a0governance system of Sri Lanka.",
    "There is also a perception that without an Executive President\u00a0national security will suffer. Yet in Commonwealth countries, the Prime Minister and the cabinet are responsible for national security. Winston Churchill whose experience PM Ranil Wickremesinghe compares with his own\u00a0 gave leadership in a war cabinet.",
    "The\u00a0tragic Easter Sunday terrorist attacks demonstrates how PM Wickremesinghe, the empowered Prime Minister of the 19th Amendment and the Executive President were incapable of responding effectively to national security.",
    "Mr. Rajapakshe presented another rather novel argument in support of the government Bill when he met the Mahanayake of Asgiriya and other monks of the Sangha Sabha in Kandy. He said that if President Rajapaksa resigns there will be no guarantee in regard to his successor, since the Pohottuwa\u00a0Party which has a majority may elect in his place, a person even less qualified than the present incumbent!! This seems a somewhat damaging assessment\u00a0of the\u00a0 \u00a0person in whose cabinet\u00a0he has taken office. Besides, Minister\u00a0\u00a0Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe must know that\u00a0\u00a0under Article 40 of our Constitution when\u00a0 a President ceases to hold office, the Prime\u00a0Minister becomes\u00a0 acting President\u00a0 until Parliament elects a new President.",
    "So we can assume that the Pohottuwa\u00a0Party government\u00a0which he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have joined will confer the mantle on Mr. Wickramasinghe. If that happens one would expect him to fulfill previous promises made on the need to abolish the Executive Presidency, and for an all party interim government that the Aragalaya,\u00a0which he says he supports, is demanding. If that does not happen the Pohottuwa government may continue without Mr. Wickremesinghe and Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Besides, if Parliament\u00a0by consensus decides to abolish the Executive Presidency, there is no reason for Minister Rajapakshe or anyone else to anguish about his successor.",
    "All these developments\u00a0indicate how we are once again trapped in diverse\u00a0political agenda which plays out as an urgent need for Constitutional reform in the name of and for\u00a0 \u201cthe People.\u201d Mr. MA Sumanthiran the only Member of\u00a0Parliament with experience and expertise on Constitutional and Public law has described the 21A (MoJ) exercise in constitutional reform of the government as minus even the 19th Amendment, and a futile exercise to effect systemic and institutional changes for accountable governance.",
    "Yet the 21A (MoJ) exercise in constitutional reform has attracted media attention as a constructive and first step towards\u00a0\u00a0good governance and responding to our desperate\u00a0 political crisis and economic collapse. Government itself has warned us that there is a threat of food insecurity\u00a0and starvation by October 2022, and a cost of living impossible\u00a0to bear. As a further panacea for these ills, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa assure us that within the time frame of this government (which they fully expect to take towards completion of their term of office)\u00a0 a NEW\u00a0 Constitution will be drafted and adopted.",
    "This assurance in particular requires us as citizens to peruse the history of Constitutional reform. For that history\u00a0gives us a sense of how much we can trust these politicians promises and\u00a0their credibility.",
    "These changes are linked with my own lived experience as a citizen of this country in this long period of fifty years.",
    "The Constitution of 1972\u00a0 was hailed as a \u201chomegrown\u201d autochthonous\u00a0Constitution that broke the link with our colonial past. It was drafted by a specially created\u00a0 Constituent Assembly with leadership of a great lawyer, Dr. Colvin R de Silva. This incorporated for the first time the concept\u00a0of the Sovereignty of the People. Unfortunately the Peoples\u2019\u00a0 Sovereignty was conceptualized as the status of\u00a0 the elected\u00a0 National State\u00a0Assembly (NSA)\u00a0 or Parliament, as the \u201cthe supreme instrument of State power,\u201d exercising the Sovereignty of the People. Even more\u00a0dangerously,\u00a0all the powers connected with governance in a democracy, i.e. the law making power, the executive power including defence handled by the President and cabinet, and the judicial power exercised through courts except in the case of privileges of Parliament were vested in the NSA. (Article 3, 4 and 5). Fundamental rights were\u00a0stated as aspirational norms and they could not be enforced in the courts.",
    "The impact of these changes on institutions of governance and individual lives is recorded in many publications of the period. Political interference with the independence of\u00a0 the public service, the judiciary, and the administration of justice,\u00a0 has been recorded. The manner in which Chief Justice Victor Tennakoon struggled to safeguard the judiciary is recorded in published research. The state monopoly\u00a0of the press and restrictions on overseas travel were also\u00a0 institutionalized\u00a0in this period. A highly\u00a0regulated economy and nationalization of private plantations had significant economic impact.",
    "My own personal life was affected when a personal vendetta against\u00a0my husband, Raja Goonesekere, then Principal of the Law\u00a0College and Chair of the Civil Rights Movement, for daring to publish a statement\u00a0critical of Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike\u2019s response\u00a0to criminal justice after the JVP uprising, led to legislation eroding the autonomy of the Council of Legal Education. My husband lost his job as Principal of the Law College on false and trumped up allegations of being a CIA agent, because he was engaged in a research project on the legal profession\u00a0 supported by an American institution. Fellow researchers\u00a0in the project were the late Neelan Tiruchelvam and the late Justice ARB Amerasinghe!",
    "The state control of media meant we could not challenge\u00a0the fake news being\u00a0published. We survived and coped with this difficult period because we had enormous family support, and\u00a0 access to the best legal advice, from our friends Suriya Wickremesinghe and late Desmond Fernando, Chula de Silva and Mr. Satyendra PC. As I reflected on the trauma suffered later\u00a0by others because of\u00a0State abuse of power, I realized how fortunate we were not to confront the arbitrary exercise of State power that placed individual lives at risk.\u00a0 We left the country despite my husband\u2019s\u00a0deep conviction: \u201cone man and one woman and one country\u201d. By the time we\u00a0returned in 1982, JR Jayewardene had won\u00a0 a landslide victory with a commitment\u00a0 to\u00a0 introduce a new constitution that would bring for the People\u00a0 Dharmishta governance based on respect for the\u00a0Rule of law and democratic values.",
    "The Jayewardene era introduced in this country the concept of an all powerful Executive President who would dominate\u00a0 \u00a0all aspects of governance. The immediate\u00a0 negative\u00a0impact on several aspects of governance\u00a0is recorded in publications on the period which\u00a0examine the\u00a0\u00a0searing experience\u00a0of ethnic and other forms of both\u00a0 State and individual acts of\u00a0 violence, especially in the period of armed conflict. However, fundamental rights were justiciable in the courts and judges like late Mark Fernando and ARB Amerasinghe supported by human rights and Constitutional\u00a0lawyers\u00a0like my husband and late HL de Silva created a body of jurisprudence that helped to make rights meaningful for people who suffered state violence and abuse of power.",
    "I was in university administration during the years of the UNP governments\u00a0of Presidents\u00a0Jayawardene and Premadasa and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 never experienced the political interference of the 1972 government. Excellent leadership by UGC Chairman Arjuna Aluvihare, and Professor Dayantha Wijesekere of the Open University helped us survive the violence and cope with the stresses. University Teachers for Human Right s (UTHR) was established in this period with the full support of Prof. Aluvihare and Vice Chancellors\u00a0like Prof Wijesekere. One great act of courage by Arjuna was when he as Vice Chancellor of the\u00a0University of Peradeniya, saved a student tied to a post on campus from being set on fire. Such acts of brutality but institutions and the legal profession functioned, with responsible leadership. Freedom of speech and expression had some space in universities though there was State violence against\u00a0journalists even in these times.",
