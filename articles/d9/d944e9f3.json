    "COLOMBO (News 1st); JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament that person wearing a helmet who got into the rear of his vehicle, was in fact a party member who was assigned to his protection detail.",
    "Anura Kumara Dissanayake said upon leaving Parliament on Tuesday (5) his vehicle was obstructed by Sri Lankan youth who were protesting outside parliament against the government.",
    "\u201cLasantha Wickremetunge was murdered in broad daylight, and yet today there is no one held responsible. Poddala Jayantha was abducted and no one was held accountable. Keith Noyahr was assaulted, and no one was arrested. (Wasim) Thajudeen was murdered and no arrests were made. A web journalist was abducted and there was no trace of him after that. All these events took place when Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Defence Secretary, and he is today the President,\u201d said Dissanayake adding that he has experience on how the President-turned Former Defense Secretary works.",
    "\u201cThat is why we have sought out our own security. Do you assume we travel alone when a person accountable for murder is seated in the top post? Whenever I travel, our comrades provide protection,\u201d he told the Parliament.",
    "\u201cBefore I leave parliament, I inform my comrades that I am about to leave, so I want a few of them to remain and they remained. What is wrong with that? I will do the same tomorrow,\u201d he added.",

    "\u201cThis is between the thief and the person who punishes the thief, the corrupt and the person who is against corruption, the Criminal and the person who is against Crimes,\u201d he said.",
    "He further said when the Security Council met over the Mirihana Protests before it happened, the Chairman of Avant-Garde Nissanka Senadhipathi had attended and said not to worry and that he had inserted 200 of his personnel to the premises.",
    "Dissanayake questioned the presence of Senadhipathi at a meeting attended by the Commanders of the Security Forces.",
    "\u201cAsk this from your leader.\u201d he snapped back at the ruling party MPs who continued to inturrupt his speech.",
