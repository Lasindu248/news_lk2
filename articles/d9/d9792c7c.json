  "body_lines": [
    "I\u2019ve always admired the performance of Lean (pronounced Leanne) and her father Nigel Galway. They are Anglo-Indians, based in Coimbatore, and they are seen in action, on a regular basis, performing live, on their own social media platform.",
    "Quite a few Sri Lankans, who have caught their live act, on social media, have been impressed by this duo.",
    "In fact, Kevin Hingert, from the group Genesis, says \u201cI love this duo.\u201d",
    "With so many bouquets coming their way, I decided to have a chit-chat with Lean.",
    "I would say I\u2019m a very calm, yet dramatic person, mainly around the people I\u2019m comfortable with. I don\u2019t really show emotions much, unless I know I won\u2019t be judged. I\u2019m friendly and pretty talkative, if the vibe is good. I also definitely stand against judging people for who they are, for I myself have a pinch of craziness, in me, and am a good listener\u2026from what I\u2019ve heard!",
    "2. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?",
    "I\u2019ve been asked this question a couple of times and, like always, I\u2019d say, NOTHING. I am the way I am, for a reason, and I\u2019m just growing, but my foundation is strong.",
    "3. If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?",
    "My family has been by my side through everything and I know they always will be. There\u2019s nothing I wanna change about my family. We\u2019re all imperfect but our love for each other is more than perfect.",
    "I completed my schooling at Stanes School ICSE /ISC, Coimbatore. School was one of the best foundations for me. I learnt very important life lessons and, for sure, my school did become my second home. I found some of the best blessings there, in the form of friends. School life will always be one of my most treasured memory.",
    "I was blinded by what the world had to offer me, and my happiness depended on earthly materials, but it never lasted. I didn\u2019t pray as often as I should have, I didn\u2019t read the Lord\u2019s word because I was \u201cbusy\u201d and life was starting to get darker until I met a friend who questioned my beliefs and I then questioned myself and the Lord gave me answers. I received the Lord with nothing but faith and that was the moment I felt true happiness and peace.",
    "My idea of perfect happiness is realising that happiness won\u2019t come to you unless you stop complaining about everything that\u2019s going wrong in your life and start looking at the number of lessons you\u2019re being taught, the growth you\u2019re experiencing, and the knowledge you\u2019re gaining , His way is God\u2019s way not yours or mine! We may not understand why our life is the way it is but leave your trust in God and just see how you will start looking at the brighter side of life and will be genuinely happy with whatever comes your way!",
    "I believe in God our Father, I believe in Christ the Son. I believe in the Holy Spirit. Our God is Three in One. My dad always told me that my temple isn\u2019t built out there, from rock or stone, but is in me \u2013 my soul. It\u2019s our soul that goes up to Heaven, so I feed it the Lord\u2019s word and keep it clean. I believe in a personal connection with God.",
    "No, I don\u2019t believe in superstitions. I personally think that superstitions make no sense because if you truly believe that God is in control of your life then a black cat crossing your path won\u2019t kill you\u2026just saying !",
    "My ideal guy is, firstly, someone that shares the same beliefs as me, I read somewhere that there is a huge difference between a Christian Man and a Man of God. I would prefer a Man of God \u2013 someone who challenges me to be the best version of myself, someone who I can hustle and grow with, be myself with, and, most importantly, be an example of the Lord\u2019s existence.",
    "My parents. They\u2019re two of the strongest people I know, regardless of the ups and downs, they\u2019ve stuck together and fought through it all. They\u2019re very down-to-earth and never show pride, or ego. The simplicity, and love for each other, that they have, is what I aspire . They sure have taught me that \u2018Storms Never Last \u2018 when you\u2019re doing life with the right person! To me, they are the definition of a Match made in Heaven!",
    "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. My most treasured possession is the kingdom of God.",
    "12. If you were marooned on a desert island, who would you like as your companion?",
    "Well, I would want my best friend to tag along, even being marooned on a desert island would be fun then! Plus, we would probably make a lot of good and crazy memories. She\u2019ll definitely like the idea (lol).",
    "I don\u2019t really get embarrassed easily, and I like roasting myself, so I would say I can\u2019t really remember anything that I would term to be my most embarrassing moment .",
    "I\u2019m a rebel when it comes to the norms of society. I just can\u2019t walk with their opinions on how I should dress, talk, walk, or anything for that matter, especially when someone says I can\u2019t do something because \u2018I\u2019m a girl\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what I would do.",
    "A world tour is a vacation I dream of. Learning new cultures and traditions has always excited me. I\u2019d love to see the variety around the world.",
    "I listen to all kinds of music but Country would always top the list. Every country song tells a story and that\u2019s the most beautiful part of the genre. I hope it never dies.",
    "I prefer reading books over using gadgets\u2026Call me old school but it helps my mind work better.",
    "If there is a next life, and I was to pick, I\u2019d most certainly pick myself again. As crazy as I am, I love every single part of the Creator\u2019s work and, yea, would love to do it, all over again.",
    "I\u2019m an Anglo-Indian and I love my culture, but it\u2019s dying out and it makes me sad to see what I grew up in is slowly disappearing. I want the world to know more about us, our culture, our cuisine, and more. I wanna save my culture from being forgotten. They say the way to anyone\u2019s heart is through food and it sure is true for me. I want to open a line of restaurants that specialise in Anglo cuisine. My parents make the best Anglo food I\u2019ve had and I want to give their recipes the recognition it deserves.",
