    "(News 1st); Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a \u201cgood understanding\u201d of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday (Apr 6).",
    "Sherman said the \u201crange of sanctions\u201d and export controls coordinated among US allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country\u2019s economy, and oligarchs should serve as an example for China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping.",
    "\u201cIt gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he support Putin in any material fashion,\u201d Sherman told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.",
    "She said Beijing should \u201ctake away the right lessons\u201d from the coordinated Western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take the democratically governed island of Taiwan by force would not be acceptable.",
    "\u201cWe hope that the PRC understands that any such action would see a response from the international community, not just from the United States,\u201d she said, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
    "China has refused to condemn Russia\u2019s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and has criticized Western sanctions on Moscow, although a senior Chinese diplomat said last week that Beijing is not deliberately circumventing those sanctions.",
    "Beijing and Moscow have developed increasingly close ties in recent years, including the announcement of a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership in February.",
    "Sherman said Beijing was showing signs of being \u201cconflicted\u201d about being so closely linked to Russia, including following the emergence of grim images of bodies of civilians shot at close range in the northern Ukrainian town of Bucha when it was retaken from Russian forces.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t see Russia as a partner. I\u2019m not naive. They do. But they have also been public to say it is not an alliance,\u201d Sherman said.",
    "US President Joe Biden warned Xi during a video call in March of \u201cconsequences\u201d for any material support to help Russia counter Western sanctions or to provide military assistance.",
    "Biden later said that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, not Russia.",
