    "UN Women together with Chrysalis recently distributed Rs. 13.4 million worth of equipment and resources to support women-owned businesses in the north of Sri Lanka.",
    "The initiative is part of a larger project to strengthen the social and economic status of women returnees in resettled communities in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts.",
    "The project aims to empower small business owners, particularly female heads of households with entrepreneurial skills to support sustainable income generation and long-term self-employment. As part of the project, over 100 women entrepreneurs and business owners were given trainings ranging from business development, financial literacy, and technology transfer.",
    "S. Rathika, a participant of the trainings conducted by UN Women and Chrysalis stated: \u201cI run my business as a confident businesswoman now. My business skills have been strengthened through the four types of business skill development trainings provided. Earlier I did not have enough knowledge on pricing my products and utilising resources efficiently. My labour management was also very poor. But since receiving these trainings, I have enhanced my skills to utilise available resources effectively and reduce unwanted expenses.\u201d",
    "The in-kind support is provided at a time when women entrepreneurs and small businesses are disproportionately impacted by higher cost of living and increased unemployment as a result of the ongoing economic crisis.",
    "The distribution ceremony was attended by key divisional, district and provincial authorities including K. Vimalanathan, Government Agent of Mullaitivu district."
