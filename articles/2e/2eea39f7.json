    "The situation in the country appears to be getting less hopeful by the day.\u00a0The Galle Face protest site reflects this despondency.\u00a0The material conditions of life are getting worse, not better. It is becoming harder for people to make the sacrifice for positive change that may not take place.\u00a0\u00a0The lines in front of petrol stations get longer. The number of them that have closed temporarily has increased.\u00a0\u00a0The Prime Minister is warning that there will be food scarcity in the next few months and people should be prepared to settle for two meals a day instead of the regular three.\u00a0\u00a0The Colombo Mayor has announced that the Municipality will set up \u201csoup kitchens\u201d to meet the needs of those who will soon have little or nothing to eat.",
    "As a cost saving measure, in these dire circumstances, the government had decided to halt all development activities.\u00a0\u00a0A plan by the previous government to provide large sums of money to local government bodies to engage in development activities has been shelved.\u00a0\u00a0Now the government is also contemplating shortening the work week by a day to conserve fuel.\u00a0\u00a0State sector employees might soon be offered the option of staying at home one day of the week, providing they engage in home garden cultivation to increase the food supply. But it is not every public servant who can engage in home gardening. The government is also proposing no-pay leave for public servants in order to be employed overseas.",
    "On the other hand, a full sized government is in the process of being selected.\u00a0 This is in contradiction to the earlier pledge made by the President to appoint a small interim government of no more than 15 ministers till the crisis in the country is overcome.\u00a0 Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said it had been decided not to pay ministerial salaries to the Cabinet ministers of the new government to be appointed in the future.\u00a0 Accordingly, it is proposed that they will receive only the average salary of a Member of Parliament.\u00a0 The better model to follow may be that of Singapore which pays public officials very well but has a policy of zero tolerance for corruption.",
    "Despite the lack of change, and due to it, new protest sites are coming into being in major urban centres though on a smaller scale in other parts of the country. These include Anuradhapura, Badulla, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura and most recently, Ja-Ela. One of the key slogans at the youth-led public protests taking place is that of systems change.\u00a0\u00a0 Systems change needs to go beyond words and requires an understanding of systems thinking means. In simple terms it is an approach to problem solving by viewing \u201cproblems\u201d as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to specific parts. And examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system. The proposed 21st Amendment may not bring about the system change and only consolidate the existing system as we see what is happening in Parliament now.",
    "The demand for systems change is accompanied by the demand that the President, Prime Minister, government and all 225 Parliamentarians should resign. This is validated by the observation that little is changing.\u00a0 The more things change it seems the more they remain the same.\u00a0 This is based on the observation that the parliamentarians continue to give priority to their own wellbeing over that of the people they have been elected to represent.\u00a0 The priority given by the parliamentarians to provide new houses to parliamentarians and to compensate those who lost their properties to arson, against those who lost their crops last season or had lost their house and property owing to conflict, does not inspire confidence in their decision-making at this time. The discrepancy becomes even more glaring in the context of the government\u2019s offer to families of the missing persons that they would provide them with Rs 100,000 as compensation.",
    "Not just parliamentarians, the homes of ordinary people and the commercial establishments they have owned have been subjected to arson, looting and destruction from the time of the first post-independence riots which usually took on communal overtones.\u00a0 This type of wanton destruction took place during the war as well.\u00a0 Innocent people who had done nothing to deserve the fate they were subjected to suffered as a result.\u00a0 The compensation they received was negligible (Rs 150,000 in 1990) in comparison to that being contemplated for the parliamentarians who have lost their properties, some of which were well beyond the extent of their known sources of income.",
    "The main change in the system that is being currently envisaged is to reduce the power of the Executive Presidency that is responsible for much of the present ills in the country.\u00a0\u00a0The present formulation of the 21st Amendment seeks to create a stronger system of checks and balances, but without reducing the President\u2019s power to appoint ministers. It seeks to establish a constitutional council that will ensure fairer and more non-partisan selection of those who will head state institutions which are part of the system of checks and balances. The 21st Amendment will ensure greater independence for those appointed to head the higher judiciary, the bribery commission, the election commission, the human rights commission, and the national audit and procurement committees. These will all provide important checks and balances against corruption and abuse of power.\u00a0\u00a0But the President will still be given the powers to pick the Prime Minister and the ministers.",
    "Systems change also needs to be accompanied by people change.\u00a0\u00a0There is a need for individuals of integrity who can transcend systems that breed corruption, as is the case with the present system.\u00a0\u00a0The Human Rights Commission is an example.\u00a0\u00a0Under the 20th Amendment that is currently the law of the land, the President can appoint anyone he wants to high positions of state, including the judiciary, the Human Rights commission, the Bribery Commission, the Elections Commission, the Police Commission and the Public Services Commission, to name but a few.\u00a0\u00a0This is a system that can lead to deference to the President\u2019s desires.\u00a0 Most commonly those selected by the President, especially those not selected on the basis of merit but for other reasons, will wish to please the President above all.",
    "However, individuals of integrity can rise above the system that brought them to those positions.\u00a0\u00a0The recently appointed chairperson of the Human Rights Commission, former Justice Rohini Marasinghe has challenged government policy with regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is denounced by local and international Human Rights Organisations, and has questioned the police regarding their use of it.\u00a0\u00a0Under her leadership the Human Rights Commission has also demanded an explanation from the government for the reasons for the declaration of a state of emergency when the protests at Galle Face in Colombo were largely peaceful adhering to police guidelines.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the recently appointed Chairperson of the Office on Missing Persons, Mahesh Katulanda, has expressed his determination to ascertain the truth behind those who went missing, which is a break from the past.",
    "The positive results obtained by these new appointments gives rise to the hope that a new generation of leaders are round the corner and the old must give way to the new.\u00a0\u00a0One of the justifications given for retaining the president\u2019s power to appoint the Prime Minister and Ministers under the 21st\u00a0Amendment is the composition of the present Parliament which is dominated by those who will be more loyal to the former prime minister than to the present one.\u00a0\u00a0Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was selected on account of his crisis management skills and international credibility in relation to others in the current parliament who might have held the position.\u00a0But this can only be a first step.\u00a0The way out of this dilemma is to dissolve this unsatisfactory Parliament as soon as possible and hold general elections as the second step.\u00a0Hopefully, the new Parliament that is elected will think anew and be able to give priority to the country\u2019s needs rather than to their personal needs including abolishing the executive presidency.",
