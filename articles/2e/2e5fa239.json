    "The former minister had agreed to a price revision every Friday based on the dollar rate against the rupee. But with the issues within the government, our request was not upheld, Gankanda said.",
    "Meanwhile, pharmacies confront an issue with keeping certain types of medicines, such as\u00a0 insulin vials,\u00a0 certain types of vaccines, eye-drops and suppositories at the appropriate low temperature ranges owing to frequent power cuts, he said.",
    "He said all other medical varieties should be kept below 25\u2070 Celsius to preserve their strength, he said.",
    "Even though several pharmacies have their own generators, they are unable to get sufficient fuel to operate them, Gankanda said.",
    "Moreover, insulin vials, certain types of vaccines, eye-drops, and suppositories should be kept between 2\u2070 and 8\u2070 Celsius, he said.",
    "Therefore, the ACPPOA has appealed to the government to take immediate action to provide adequate diesel to drive their generators and to maintain the appropriate temperature to provide quality medicines for people.",
