    "Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara says alternative methods are in place to continue the fuel distribution without interruption if private bowser owners withdraw from services.",
    "Taking to his official Twitter handle, the minister said the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) has been instructed to open registration immediately for new suppliers to transport fuel and to cancel the registration of those who fail to report for duty.",
    "Trains, government-owned, fuel station-owned and privately-hired bowsers that are not on strike will continue the fuel distribution services, he added.",
    "According to the minister, a total of 381 bowsers were used for deliveries this evening, including 84 government-owned bowsers, 103 fuel station bowsers and 194 hired bowsers not on strike.",
    "He said sufficient stocks of Auto Diesel, Super Diesel, 92 Octane Petrol and kerosene are in stock and are being released to filling stations. However, limited stocks of 95 Octane Petrol are being released to the market.",
    "He also noted that the rates for hired fuel bowsers have been adjusted 5 times since July 2021, an increase of 84% using a formula agreed by all."
