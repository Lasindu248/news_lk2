    "The drama caused by the Former Chairman of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will result in dire consequences especially if the Indian Govt gets offended and refuses assistance to Sri Lanka, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Deputy Leader P. Digambaram said today.",
    "\u201cIndia appears to be offended by the statement made by the Chairman of the CEB that the Indian head of state had pressurised his Sri Lankan counterpart. The situation in Sri Lanka is bound to get worse if India refuses to assist. Sri Lanka has managed to survive to some extent because of Indian assistance. Imagine what would happen to Sri Lanka if India refuses to assist anymore,\u201d Digambaram said.",
    "\u201cPeople are already affected by fuel, gas and food shortages and skyrocketing cost of living, We might see anarchy in the future as people will attack shops and even super markets while there will be snatching of chains in the future if they can\u2019t find food at affordable prices.\u201d he added.",
    "He said the estate community is also severely affected by the current economic situation. \u201cFlour is the staple food of the estate community. They make rotti out of flour. However flour is not available today while the prices have also gone up. We met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently and requested that the estate labourers be given neglected land so that they can grow food crops on them . However this program is yet to get off the ground,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
