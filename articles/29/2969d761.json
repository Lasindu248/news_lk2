    "(News 1st); Russian President, Vladimir Putin has authorized the Government, the central bank, and Gazprombank to take the necessary steps to switch all payments for Russian natural gas from \u201cunfriendly states\u201d to rubles starting 31st March 2022.",
    "The measure targets \u201cmember states of the EU and other countries that have introduced restrictions against citizens of the Russian Federation and Russian legal entities,\u201d the mandate published on the Kremlin website reads.",
    "Russia will stop shipping natural gas to countries refusing to settle payments in rubles, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.",
    "The decision, first announced last week, came as Russia\u2019s oil trade has been left in disarray as importers put orders on hold due to the latest sanctions introduced against Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine.",
    "The conflict in Ukraine and the anti-Russia sanctions that followed have raised concerns of a global economic crisis.",
    "Skyrocketing commodity prices are sending the costs of consumer goods, energy, and food ever higher, giving rise to fears of a possible recession in many countries and even hunger in some parts of the world.",
    "Russia\u2019s decision to switch payments to its domestic currency has been made in response to the unprecedented penalties imposed by the US and its allies on the country\u2019s financial system.",
    "The ruble plummeted to record lows after Western nations and Japan blocked Russia\u2019s access to some of its international reserves. Since last week\u2019s currency-switch announcement, the ruble has reached its strongest level against the US dollar and the euro in nearly a month.",
