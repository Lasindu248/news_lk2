    "The fuel distribution in the country may grind to a halt as bowser owners didn't turn up for duties at the Kolonnawa refinery yard following the widespread protests and unrest in the country, the Sri Lanka Petroleum Private Tanker Owners' Association (SLPPTOA) today said.",
    "In a letter to the Manager of the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) in Kolonnawa Terminal, the Association said that the bowser owners are reluctant or unable to report to work over personal safety issues following mass protests almost everywhere in the country.",
    "Therefore, it is not possible to run the bowsers for fuel distribution.\u00a0 A fleet of nearly 250 bowsers carry fuel to many parts of the country on daily basis, whereas only six were present today. Those bowser owners are from the western province, \"the association said.",
    "The association also requested a written assurance from the CPSTL for a safer method to report to work to continue the fuel distribution. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
