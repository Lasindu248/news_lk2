    "The country is looking to the parliament today for answers to an unprecedented economic crisis that the country is facing. Each time this parliament meets people have expectations that there would be some change, some forward movement to resolve this crisis.",
    "And the people are disappointed because this was a parliament when it was constituted, or soon thereafter. Where there was two third \u2018s support for the government. With that 2/3rd support that they gathered, they brought an amendment to the constitution, the 20th amendment, and strengthened the hands of the President, which was by the 19th Amendment taken back to Parliament somewhat; that was reversed.",
    "The President\u2019s own election manifesto in 2019, the \u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendor\u201d (is a document) I urge everyone in this country to read. You will die laughing before you actually die of hunger, if you read that manifesto and compare it to the state that the country is in today. In the manifesto, before I deal with other matters; the one very specific proposal that he made, at page 36 and 37 in the English version where at page 37, he very specifically says \u201cincome tax will be reduced, economic service charge and withholding tax will be scrapped. A simple value added tax of 8 % will be introduced, replacing both the current VAT of 15 % and the Nation building tax of 2 %, PAYE tax will be scrapped and personal income tax will be subject to a ceiling of 15 %, a five-year moratorium will be granted on taxes payable by agriculturist and small and medium enterprises\u201d and so on.",
    "Huge tax reliefs were announced in his election manifesto \u2013 it was an election promise. I want to table those two pages, titled chapter 5 \u201cPeople Centric Economy\u201d page 36 and 37. I am tabling it.",
    "At that time itself, the finance minister of this country, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, specifically addressed this election promise and he stated that if this proposal is implemented \u2013 he did that on October 19, 2019 at a press conference where he addressed the issue of these promises that candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave this country.",
    "And what did Mangala Samaraweera say? He said, \u201cIf these are implemented Sri Lanka will become like Lebanon and Venezuela. Unfortunately, or fortunately for him, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is not with us today, but his prediction has come true, his warning has come true. On October 30, 2019 he tweeted \u2013 it\u2019s still there in Twitter and I am going to table Mangala Samaraweera\u2019s tweet. This is what he said, \u201cGota\u2019s tax plan wants to set Sri Lanka on an express train to bankruptcy, default and a Greek-style debt crisis. That change alone equivalent to heath, defense or pensions budgets. Certainly doesn\u2019t need advice for PR agencies conjured business communities\u201d.",
    "So one cannot say that there were no warnings. The Finance Minister of the country at that time said this. The Prime minister now wants to set up a parliamentary budget office. During the last Parliament we had that draft and all of that was set up but it was never presented to Parliament. Recently he asked me for the draft and I have sent it to him, and hope that will be done.",
    "One of the tasks of the parliamentary budget office is that when somebody makes a promise \u2013 an election promise \u2013 that office will have to immediately calculate the impact of that promise and publish a report saying this is how it will impact the economy. Unfortunately, we did not have the parliamentary budget office to say that, but nevertheless the minister of finance said it more than once. But voters were duped. They were told (they\u2019ll have a) strong country, a strong leader. Do we have a strong leader today? The Easter Sunday attacks were also carried out earlier, and voters were duped. And these tax cuts were actually implemented in December 2019. The single (biggest) reason we are in this predicament today (are those tax cuts). I am not saying that\u2019s the only reason, but that was the trigger, because it was only after that, beginning April 2020 that our ratings started falling.",
    "When the rating started falling, the Central Bank under the Monetary Law gave confidential reports and I believe they cautioned the government that we will not be able to borrow anymore. By July/August 2020, we were shut out of international financial markets. And that\u2019s it! That\u2019s what happened. So the person who alone is responsible for this economic crisis is still the head of government. He is still president. Some people are saying, \u201cNo. no. don\u2019t look at this politics \u2013 let that be \u2013 deal with the economic crisis\u201d\u2026 yes of cause, to deal with the economic crisis the wrongdoer must be removed. You can\u2019t keep the wrongdoer, the one who is mostly responsible, in that chair and deal with the crisis.",
    "How can he (remain in that chair)? Why did the prime minister resign? Why did the entire cabinet resign? Why did the governor of the central bank resign? Why did the secretary to the treasury resign? Why did all of that happen? Why did, suddenly, 40 or 42 members who were seated in the government benches declare themselves to be independent? Now this is the new fashion. This Parliament no longer consist of a government side and an opposition side, this Parliament now consist of independent MPs \u2013 Independent MPs \u2013 a new fashion. Each one stands up says I am independent, as if that is some big thing; some virtuous thing. You need to be independent anyway, that\u2019s another matter, but our system is that of a government and opposition.",
    "That is why we have an aisle in the centre (or this chamber) \u2013 that is why our Standing Orders say that we can\u2019t cross that aisle unless we are crossing over \u2013 we are changing sides. It doesn\u2019t even say that. It merely says you can\u2019t cross that aisle. This Parliamentary system is one where you have two sides. This Parliamentary system is not one where you have independent MPs. This Parliament has failed if it says everybody sitting here is an independent MP. That is not our system.",
    "So therefore the President must definitely step down; there might be some interim relief that he has got by Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe taking the position of prime minister. Where in the parliamentary democracy do you have this kind of prime minister? He\u2019s a single MP from his party only \u2013 one person, (appointed) to give relief to the government that\u2019s at sixes and sevens. The President has lost his mandate, the President is the wrongdoer who caused this huge economic calamity, so he must move, he must step down. Or he must be removed.",
    "The Parliament also has lost its mandate. You had two thirds; what do you have now? Groups within the government, so and so\u2019s group, the other person\u2019s group, another person\u2019s group all calling themselves independent MPs. Parliament has lost its legitimacy, its mandate. There must be an overhaul of this system. But before that, Parliament also needs to be dissolved, it is anyway dissolved into independents. It has been dissolved, I mean in actual fact it is dissolved. So at least formally you must dissolve it now.",
    "So I say to those out there who think that this is merely playing politics: No! it is not. Until you set this right you are not going to even begin to address the economic issue. Every institution has told this country \u201cyou know there must be political stability.\u201d How do you have political stability with this parliament of independent MPs? You have no stability at all. We must understand that we are part of a problem now; we are unable to give solutions. People are looking to us for solutions. We are not finding them. We are only crying about our houses being burnt, we are only crying about this, that and the other. We are not giving any solutions. And we can\u2019t give solutions so long as this kind of political instability continues in this country.",
    "Every day of delay in establishing stability costs the country several million dollars. So it must be fixed fast We are part of a problem and we must say \u201cYes, we\u2019ll dissolve ourselves\u201d, pass a resolution and request the President to dissolve Parliament. One of the biggest promises given by the President himself in his last address to the Nation, he said so, and by the Prime Minister very categorically are that they will do two things, that they will bring back the 19th amendment (to replace) the 20th amendment you brought with such fanfare. The former minister of justice is here, he moved that bill and suddenly he said \u201cno, no, 20th is bad, now we will change it, we will abandon it, we\u2019ll repeal it, we\u2019ll bring back the 19th and then we\u2019ll start the process of abolishing the executive presidency itself.\u201d",
    "Both the President and the prime minister within the last two weeks have given the country that assurance. But where are you now? You can\u2019t even bring back the 19th amendment. Some draft was produced, discussed with us, members of the opposition, the party leaders, with all kinds of dilution. We said alright, still do it, do it! What happened on Monday at the Cabinet meeting? Nothing has come out, you are unable to even give effect to that promise.",
    "A highly watered down version of bringing back the \u2013 you call it the 21st, 21st is what Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara (SJB) has presented to Parliament. That is a substantial one. Then at least support that to be passed if you are serious about your promises. If you are unable to finalize the draft, if you have no unanimity in the cabinet to do that (then the) cabinet has failed. This Parliament is unable to do anything because there is no one side that can support any reform.",
    "This relief budget will be most welcomed but we will have to look at it to see what there is in it. We are waiting to see what your draft amendment to the constitution is. We will have to wait for it. But the longer we wait, the more serious the economic crisis becomes and those who are affected by that are most ordinary citizens and the poorest of this country. And we don\u2019t seem to think about them or care about them.",
