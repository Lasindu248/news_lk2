    "A heated cross talk in lighter vein took place between Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and opposition members in Parliament today when Minister Aluthgamage mischievously remarked that a prominent MP from Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is ready to join with the government and some more SJB MPs will be backing Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in two weeks time.",
    "\u201cMP Harsha de Silva is waiting to join with the government soon and will work with us to revive the economy,\u201d Minister Aluthgamage quipped.",
    "In response MP Harsha De Silva replied, \u201cThe entire team of us will take seats on that side soon,\u201d to the applause of the opposition benches.",
    "Not taken aback Minister Aluthgamage continued to rile the opposition: \u201cI can tell the opposition leader that around ten SJB MPs will start backing Mr. Wickremesinghe in two weeks time.\u00a0 Eight SJB MPs have already finalised matters with regard to joining him while two others are having a dialogue with Mr. Wickremesinghe. An MP whose name starts with H. One whose name starts with R, and another whose name starts with E will be joining Mr. Wickremesinghe.\u201d",
    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa responded mockingly thanking the Minister stating as he had revealed the real objective behind the All Party Conference. \u201cWe thank Minister Aluthgamage for revealing the real objective and the drama behind the All Party Conference,\u201d he said.
