    "COLOMBO; Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that if he is ousted from power, he will not recognize an opposition government.",
    "He was speaking ahead of a no-confidence vote in parliament on Saturday, which he is expected to lose.",
    "Khan said he accepted the Supreme Court decision that he must face the vote, but repeated claims the US is leading a conspiracy to remove him. He did not provide evidence.",
    "Khan visited Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin as Russia was launching the invasion of Ukraine and has previously criticized the US\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d.",
    "International media say the Prime Minister is widely regarded as having come to power with the help of Pakistan\u2019s army, but now observers say they have fallen out.",
    "During his Friday address, Khan urged people to come out of their houses to protest against the \u201cforeign-funded drama\u201d on Sunday.",
    "He added: \u201cI will be there with you as I will never accept this foreign conspiracy against Pakistan.\u201d",
    "The leader of the opposition, Shehbaz Sharif, said the decision to go forward with a vote of no-confidence had \u201csaved Pakistan and the constitution\u201d.",
    "Saturday\u2019s confidence vote comes after opposition lawmakers put forward a no-confidence motion to parliament last Sunday, in a bid to oust Khan from power.",
    "But parliament\u2019s deputy speaker Qasim Suri \u2013 a member of Khan\u2019s political party \u2013 swiftly blocked the vote, saying it showed \u201cforeign interference\u201d. Suri also said that it went against the constitution, which calls for loyalty to the state.",
    "Khan\u2019s government went on to dissolve parliament and called for a snap election to be held.",
    "This made several opposition members furious, with some accusing the prime minister of \u201ctreason\u201d for blocking the vote.",
    "Opposition figures submitted a petition to the Supreme Court to assess the situation.",
    "On Thursday, Pakistan\u2019s top court ruled that Khan\u2019s decision to stop the vote from going ahead was unconstitutional. It ordered that the no-confidence vote should go ahead again on Saturday, 9 April.",
    "Khan has repeatedly said that Pakistan\u2019s opposition parties are working with foreign powers.",
    "He claims that he is the target of a US-led conspiracy to remove him because he refused to stand with Washington on issues against Russian and China. The US said there was \u201cno truth\u201d in these allegations.",
    "The expectation is that the former international cricket star will lose Saturday\u2019s no-confidence vote.",
    "If Khan is ousted from power, the opposition parties will appoint a new prime minister who can hold power until October 2023, when a new election is scheduled to be held.",
    "International has a report saying it is unclear what other options Khan can exercise to avoid that outcome unless he and his MPs decide to resign in an attempt to avoid the humiliation of a defeat.",
