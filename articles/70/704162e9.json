    "Appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is similar to the political conspiracy hatched by former President Maithripala Sirisena, who appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister through the backdoor in 2018, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.",
    "He told a news conference that it was against the mandate of this government to appoint Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, as President Rajapaksa came to power by promising to punish the latter over the failure to prevent Easter Sunday attacks and over the Central Bank Bond scam.",
    "\"How can this appointment be different from forming a conspiracy government in 2018? Maithripala appointed his rival Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister going against the mandate. Gotabaya has also done the same thing today. They are playing with people's lives and aspirations,\" he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
