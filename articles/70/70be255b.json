  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has issued a statement requesting the public to express their dissent peacefully, without targeting private property or causing destruction to property.",
    "Moreover, the BASL emphasizes that such conduct is criminal and can lead to protestors being charged in Courts of Law.",
    "The BASL also mentions that if a peaceful protest becomes violent, it will only dilute the proper objective of the protest and will strengthen the hand of those who seeks to suppress legitimate dissent."
