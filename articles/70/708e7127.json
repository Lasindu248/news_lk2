    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Foreign minister G L Peiris had informal discussions with representatives of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) core group of countries on Sri Lanka on Friday (18) in Colombo.",
    "A foreign ministry statement did not elaborate on the discussions, but noted that ministry secretary Jayanath Colombage also took part.",
    "The core group comprises Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi, Montenegro, the United Kingdom, and the United States. At the 49th session of the UNHRC session in Geneva earlier this month, the core group said its concern over surveillance and intimidation of civil society persists, and detentions, threats and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders continue while the proposed changes to the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) are very limited.",
    "\u201cThe new \u2018One Country One Law\u2019 taskforce risks undermining Sri Lanka\u2019s pluralist society. We urge Sri Lanka to ensure that this taskforce\u2019s work is inclusive and non-discriminatory,\u201d the UK\u2019s Global Ambassador for Human Rights Rita French in her statement on behalf of\u00a0the core group said.",
    "The \u2018One Country One Law\u2019 task force is headed by a controversial Buddhist monk appointed to the position by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The monk\u2019s name has been linked to anti-Muslim violence in the island nation.",
    "Sri Lanka claimed \u201coverwhelming\u201d and cross-regional support, particularly from the global south, at the interactive dialogue of the UNHRC session. However, Western countries noted setbacks on the human rights front and called for increased engagement with minority political parties.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka received overwhelming support from countries of the global south who expressed support for the government\u2019s significant efforts towards reconciliation and reiterated the importance of objective and constructive cooperation as the fundamental basis for multilateral engagement,\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement last Tuesday (08).",
    "However, the United States, which recently joined the core group, called for increased engagement with Tamil and Muslim parties and civil society organisations to \u201cadvance an inclusive, lasting political solution\u201d.",
    "The UK, meanwhile, noting continued lack of progress on accountability and \u201csetbacks in several emblematic human rights cases\u201d, called on the Sri Lankan government to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 passed in March 2021 and to cooperate with the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner (OHCHR). (Colombo/Mar19/2022)"
