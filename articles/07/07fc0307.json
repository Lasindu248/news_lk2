    "Accordingly, the remains buried at the Ampara cemetery will be unearthed tomorrow morning (April 27).",
    "By re-examining the DNA, the investigators intend to find out whether the remains of Pulasthini Mahendran alias Sara Jasmine, a converted Islamic extremist and part of Zahran Hashim\u2019s terror group, are among those who died inside the Sainthamaruthu safe house raided on the 26th of April 2019.",
