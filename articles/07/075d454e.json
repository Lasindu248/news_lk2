    "Maestro Rukshan Perera is one artiste who is regularly in the news, and grabs the spotlight, in a big way, every time an important event, or a disaster, takes place in the country, or in the world.",
    "What makes him extra special is his ability to compose songs, connected with such events.",
    "He wrote \u2018Rise Up Sri Lanka,\u2019 as a tribute to the victims of the Easter Sunday Attacks; \u2018I Can\u2019t Breathe,\u2019 when George Floyd was throttled to death in the US; \u2018Has the World Stopped Turning,\u2019 when Covid brought the world to a standstill\u2026and many more. In fact, Rukshan has a collection of more than 100 songs.",
    "You can check out most of these songs on his YouTube channel \u2018Rukshan Perera.\u2019",
    "To support the struggle at Galle Face, in Colombo, Rukshan has, once again, come up with some power lyrics to express the people\u2019s sufferings in the country, and he has done it with \u2018Bring Back Paradise.\u2019",
    "The line \u201cThe country\u2019s weeping, hopes are dying, children are starving tonight,\u201d shows the pathetic situation, and the sufferings, in the country today. \u201cLet\u2019s fight for justice with all our might, together day and night, The winds of change is on the rise, for our children, we\u2019ll bring back paradise\u2026,\u201d",
    "Yes, indeed, these lyrics give encouragement to the protestors at GGG and also hope for the country\u2026\u201cthat we are serious this time and we will continue to fight until we have a massive change in the political landscape and that, through the protests, we will bring back the country, to be called, once again, \u2018paradise,\u2019\u201d says Rukshan.",
    "The chorus speaks to the current leaders, loud and clear\u2026\u201cLeaders it\u2019s time to open your eyes, we are all drowning away, Embrace the change and pave the way, a new breed is on its way,\u201d and this is another powerful line, demanding that the current leaders embrace the changes, that is echoed at GGG, and that all 225 must go, to be replaced by a new breed of honest politicians who will work for the country, with no corruption, and not for themselves.",
    "The video, for \u2018Bring Back Paradise,\u2019 according to Rukshan, has a lady airing her family sufferings, with no food for children, questioning if politicians\u2019 children are also starving\u2026etc., and plenty of other footages, depicting the current situation, in the country, and the struggle at Galle Face.",
    "This well-crafted song, says Rukshan, has three powerful messages. 1) It shows the sufferings of the people, 2) The struggle at GGG, and its demands, and finally 3) Giving the much needed hope for Sri Lankans to \u201cBring Back Paradise\u201d to what it should be.",
    "It\u2019s time to rise and turn the tide, change darkness into light,",
    "The country\u2019s weeping, hopes are dying, children are starving tonight,",
    "Let\u2019s fight for justice with all our might, together day and night,",
    "The winds of change is on the rise, for our children, we\u2019ll bring back paradise,",
    "The country\u2019s weeping, hopes are dying, children are starving tonight,",
    "Let\u2019s fight for justice with all our might, together day and night,",
    "The winds of change is on the rise, for our children, we\u2019ll bring back paradise,",
    "Leaders it\u2019s time to open your eyes, we are all drowning away,",
    "Embrace the change and pave the way, a new breed is on its way,",
    "The country\u2019s weeping, hopes are dying, children are starving tonight,",
    "Let\u2019s fight for justice with all our might, together day and night,",
    "The winds of change is on tonight, for our children, we\u2019ll bring back paradise,",
