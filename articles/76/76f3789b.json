  "body_lines": [
    "Former Minister Mervyn Silva said that opposition parties could bring in a no-confidence motion to overthrow the government rather than bringing people in buses and forcing them to participate in political rallies.",
    "The Transport for these people are funded by businessmen who in turn fund political campaigns. This trend has to stop, he said.",
    "\"People filled the streets of Colombo in the SJB protest. Some were given rice packets, some were singing etc. If Sajith wants to gain power he shouldn\u2019t resort to such ignorant actions,\" Silva said."
