    "The Aeroflot airlines aircraft which had been detained at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake, has departed for Moscow a short while ago following the suspension of the court order.",
    "Aeroflot Airlines Airbus A330-300 flight SU-289 departed BIA at around 6.00 p.m. this evening along with its crew members, Ada Derana reporter said.",
    "The Colombo Commercial High Court today suspended the order preventing a detained flight from leaving Sri Lanka, paving the way for the Russian flag carrier\u2019s aircraft to depart for Moscow.",
    "The court had considered a motion filed by the Attorney General and suspended the previous order which had led to the detention of the Aeroflot aircraft.",
    "The Airbus A330-343 aircraft, scheduled to depart from Colombo to Moscow on June 2 with 191 passengers and 13 crew members, was not allowed as the owner of the aircraft -- Celestial Aviation of Ireland -- had filed a case against Aeroflot, pending arbitration on the lease of the aircraft in London."
