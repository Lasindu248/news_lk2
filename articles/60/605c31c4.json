    "The Movement to Protect Patients\u2019 Rights (MPPR) has written to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the restructuring of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA).",
    "MPPR Joint Secretary C. Perera in the letter has said the National Medicines Regulatory Policy was implemented after long consultation with all stakeholders. The intention was to establish an independent body to regulate, minimise corruption and make available quality medicines at affordable prices to the general public. \u201cWe are made to understand there is relentless lobbying by interested parties to bring this under the preview of the MOH where corruption is rampant, a very well-known fact. If at all such a drastic change is to be made, it should be done after wider discussion with all stakeholders,\u201d the letter said.",
    "\u201cHope no hasty decisions are made that would cause far reaching consequences that bring more financial hardship to the patients,\u201d the MPPR letter to the Prime Minister added."
