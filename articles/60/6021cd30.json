    "Leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake says the majority of the properties of former Minister Basil Rajapaksa are listed under Thirukumar Nadesan, the husband of former Minister Nirupama Rajapaksa who was named in Pandora Papers.",
    "He mentioned this at a special media briefing convened today (May 03) to spill the beans on the corruption and frauds committed by politicians in Sri Lanka within the past two decades.",
    "Speaking of Gin Nilwala Diversion Project, MP Dissanayake said the Irrigation Ministry had paid a total of Rs. 4,100 million to a China-based company named China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd. as several tranches between December 24, 2014 and January 06, 2015, prior to the election for the said project.",
    "He disclosed that this Chinese firm had later released USD 5 million to a company owned by Nadesan, on several occasions. The company in question then transferred money to a local bank in Kollupitiya and the money deposited in this account was used to purchase the infamous piece of land in Malwana, the JVP leader continued.",
    "With regard to the financial irregularities allegedly committed during the multi-billion dollar aircraft purchase involving the national carrier and Europe-based Airbus, the parliamentarian said the meeting of the SriLankan Airlines board of directors on signing the deal was held at the official residence of Chamal Rajapaksa, whose son was a also member of the SriLankan board of directors."
