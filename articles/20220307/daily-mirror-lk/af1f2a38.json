    "He told a press conference that SJB cannot be silenced or deterred by such an attack.",
    "\" We will go ahead with our planned protest against the government in Colombo on March 15 and we challenge this MP to come and compete with us on that day. This MP should go and attack crowds at filling stations. He will get chased by the people without any doubt,\" he said.",
