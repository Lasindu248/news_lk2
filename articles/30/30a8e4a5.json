    "UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardene today hinted that there will be a national consensus soon where all the parties will get together to resolve the crisis which Sri Lanka has been plunged into and Ranil Wickremesinghe will play a major role in it.",
    "Abeywardedne told a press conference that the need of the hour was to establish a national consensus forgetting party politics.",
    "\"It is also essential to hand over the nation to the best person who could pull the country through from the present economic crisis. The best person who could handle the economy is Mr. Wickremesinghe,\u201d Abeywardene said.",
    "\u201c I think and feel that the former Prime Minister will become the custodian of\u00a0 the nation,\u201d Abeywardene said in response to a question raised by\u00a0 journalists as\u00a0 to whether Wickremesinghe will get a prominent post in the future.",
    "\u201c What Sri Lanka needs is a political reform similar to that of Russia in 1999 where the then Russian \u00a0President Boris Yelstin appointed Vladimir Putin as the Prime Minister. Mr. Puttin performed successfully and then became the President of the nation,\u201d Abeywardene said.",
    "\u201cSome of the political leaders want the present rulers to hand over the nation to them and they will perform. However things should be other way round where one has to perform first\u00a0 to prove themselves,\u201d he also said. (Yohan Perera)"
