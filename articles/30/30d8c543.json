    "For some of us who admire the splendour of a great architectural structure, it doesn\u2019t really cross their minds how safety and durability of a building and its structure is important, after all. Rohana Shoring & Piling is a Sri Lankan company which is focused on this vital area of construction projects for over 15 years and has been providing solid and secure foundations for some of the most iconic landmarks in Sri Lanka. They provide a trusted assurance for you to continue building-up that valuable project with much confidence.",
    "Superior quality of services offered by Rohana Shoring & Piling along with the dedication of its experienced and industry qualified staff could be defined as the backbone of a number of successfully completed structures, proudly presented by well recognised construction and project management companies in Sri Lanka.",
    "The company, in the occasion of un-veiling their new website www.rohanashoring.com and the revamped corporate logo at Avenra Garden Hotel, Negombo would like to reach-out to the world with a new message. It will be an accelerated way forward with its own team and all those who joined hands in their journey of business activities so far.",
    "Rohana Shoring & Piling would plan to reach certain areas of the construction industry which was not directly handled by its team of experts in the past. Existing clientele and others could expect additional services related to construction and project management from a company with a reliable track record.",
    "Our outlook to the future involves further developing our line of expertise to match the ever-growing demand in the field. We hope to become pioneers in challenging and complex building projects by identifying problems with soil, dealing with rocks in site areas, and building on slopes or hills. We are planning to provide these services for our own building projects or third-party assignments in the near future and would look forward to serve you even better, Rohana Shoring & Piling Director Rohan Saman Kumar Silva, mentioned at the recent gathering."
