    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka police have arrested all suspects linked to the murder of a cabinet minister\u2019s driver that occurred Monday (21) evening, a local police officer told EconomyNext Tuesday (22) afternoon.",
    "The driver of Energy Minister Gamini Lokuge was stabbed Monday evening in his residence in Gamwanawatta, Pilyandala, after an argument with a motorcyclist escalated.",
    "According to the police media division, the argument had ensued after the victim had warned the motorcyclist against reckless driving. The motorcyclist had left the scene and subsequently returned with his parents, an older brother and two other men.",
    "The group had attacked the 41-year-old victim with a club and also stabbed him with a sharp object. The suspects had then fled the scene.",
    "An officer at the Kesbewa police station said all suspects were taken into custody following an investigation, though according to the official police media statement, only one is currently behind bars.",
    "The news of the attack immediately led to speculation on social media that it was connected to Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis, which has resulted in long queues for essentials and an increasingly frustrated public looking to vent. Four people have died in fuel queues in under 48 hours, one of whom was stabbed to death near a filling station.",
    "However, police said the murder of Minister Lokuge\u2019s driver was over a personal matter.",
    "The body of the deceased is presently placed in the Pilyandala hospital morgue, police said. (Colombo/Mar22/2022)"
