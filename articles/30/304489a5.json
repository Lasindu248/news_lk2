    "\u201cThe organized groups of thugs emerged from the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence. We have learnt that thousands from many parts of the country were brought there and were given food, liquor, money and then sent to carry out the attack with poles,\u201d the Venerable Thero said.",
    "\u201cThe terrorism stemming out of Temple Trees, was the root cause for all acts of terrorism and violence,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cTherefore, we filed a complain with the police headquarters and the IGP to arrest the leaders who formed these terrorist groups at Temple Trees. It\u2019s very clear that terrorist leaders like former prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Johnston Fernando manipulated these groups which acted as slaves,\u201d said the Venerable Thero adding that law enforcement officers don\u2019t have the right or duty to protect criminals who incite terrorism and then cause it to spread in the country.",
