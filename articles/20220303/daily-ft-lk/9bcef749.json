    "\u201cBeing among the few in the world and probably the first pest management company in Asia to be listed, will have a significant impact in enhancing the brand recognition in the emerging world that will help us move into unchartered territories with minimal challenges,\u201d he said.",

The company plans to commence the Maldives operations in 2022, Seychelles and Botswana in 2023,\u201d Ferreira added.",
