    "Weerawansa faults Mahinda and Johnston for inciting supporters; Gammanpila decries State terrorism",
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena said that the present Government has committed the most foolish act in recent history by aiding and abetting a mob attack on peaceful protesters in front of Galle Face Green and Temple Trees.",
    "The former President said the country would suffer the consequences of the Government\u2019s action both locally and internationally, adding that this was an act that should not be done by a Government.",
    "Sirisena made this statement addressing a media briefing at the office of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka by independent groups of parliamentarians. The former President said that the attack on innocent people carried out by the ruling party supporters with the backing of the Government was a heinous act and condemned it with contempt.",
    "Sirisena said in the aftermath of the attack, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will also have to soon step down as the President.",
    "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (JHU) Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said since according to the criminal law, all those who aided and abetted a crime should be arrested and all those who supported the attack on peaceful protesters should be arrested for complicity in the crime. Without doing so, the Government will not be able to bring peace and tranquillity to the people, he said.",
    "MP Gammanpila said the failure of the police to stop Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s supporters from reaching the peaceful protest site at Galle Face and to call in the security forces for the safety of the peaceful protesters while a state of emergency was in effect was a big question.",
    "Strongly denouncing the State Terrorism which brutally attacked the peaceful protestors, MP Gammanpila said this kind of oppression would further strengthen People\u2019s Struggle.",
    "Parliamentarian Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said that this incident was a black mark in the history of Sri Lanka and that the President, the just resigned Prime Minister and all members of the Government should take responsibility and leave. He added that they have committed an offense before the law",
    "National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa also condemned the attack on peaceful protestors and faulted Mahinda Rajapaksa and MP Johnston Fernando for inciting supporters."
