    "The objective of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is to push for an election by denying the majority enjoyed by the present government in Parliament, its MP Mayantha Dissanayake said today.",
    "\u201cFormer Minister Wimal Weerawansa has said he will work towards forming a new government by denying the majority enjoyed by the government, but our policy is to push for an election,\u201d Mr. Dissanayake told a media briefing.",
    "Also, he said the ideology of SJB is that the current economic crisis should be resolved through a collective effort of political parties representing Parliament. \u201cWe believe that the present economic crisis should be resolved by Parliament, as it is the legislature which holds power over finances,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere should not be any under the table deals at the All Party Conference,\u201d he added.",
    "MP J. C. Alawathuwela who also participated in the press conference said the All Party Conference is a political drama that has been engineered by the government to save its face. Asked about the report which said there are internal issues with SJB and that ten MPs will back former Prime Minister in Parliament, Mr. Alawathuwela said this is absurd lies. \u201cIt was Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who came out with this false statement. He should not be taken seriously as he is known for making false statements.\u00a0\u00a0(Yohan Perera)"
