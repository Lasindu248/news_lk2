  "body_lines": [
    "Minister Namal Rajapaksa today said there was no truth in him having to attend an event in Bandarawela due to which a group of people had to be shifted from queues at a fuel station in the area.",
    "Namal told Daily Mirror that he had no event in Welimada and this was a false rumor spread to create unwanted panic.",
    "\u201cEven if I am to attend any event, I will ensure that no one\u2019s lives are disrupted. The queues right now are unfortunate but moving them to another area, is something I will never consent to. I have never done that. This is all a false rumor and a clear miscommunication,\u201d Namal said.",
    "Videos today emerged of school van drivers lining up at one particular petrol filling station in Bandarawela, who had been granted special permission by the Divisional Secretariat for getting their fuel quota from that particular filling station.",
    "Some of the drivers however claimed that they were moved to another station on Welimada Road after being told by certain individuals that the area had to be cleared due to Minister Namal Rajapaksa\u2019s arrival in the area. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
