    "The issue of the masked military personnel at demonstrations outside the parliamentary premises was brought up in Parliament today as the main opposition raised concerns about the matter, and called for an unbiased investigation.",
    "Addressing the parliamentary session, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today denounced the conduct of police officers who attacked uniformed army soldiers on a motorbike, in front of protesters at the roadblock near the Parliament Complex.",
    "The SJB lawmaker said this incident could have led to a chaotic situation.",
    "He also called for an independent investigation into the incident. \u201cIf the army soldiers are at fault the Army Commander should take appropriate action against them. If the police officers are at fault, the Inspector-General of Police should take action,\u201d he said.",
    "Speaking further, MP Fonseka said he does not condone the presence of armed soldiers at a public protest.",
    "Last evening, a group of people staged a protest in front of the entrances of the parliament premises, while the proceedings of the House were in progress. When more protesters started to gather there, the police swiftly took measures to barricade the entrances to the parliamentary complex.",
    "As the protest went on, a group of armed military personnel on motorcycles and with their faces covered had ridden towards the crowd.",
    "The police officers on duty at the time attempted to stop and question the army personnel in question, as this led to a tense situation.",
    "Following the incident, Army Commander, General Shavendra Silva called on the Inspector-General of Police C.D. Wickramaratne to carry out an investigation into the conduct of the police officers involved in the incident.",
    "In response, the IGP had apologized for the incident and assured that an unbiased probe would be launched into the matter.",
    "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa meanwhile urged the government to reveal who these masked individuals were. \u201cWe saw that there were uniformed individuals wearing masks, riding unregistered motorbikes while carrying weapons and heading towards the protesters and confronting the police. [\u2026] I would like to know who they were, riding motorbikes that did not have number plates. Are they a separate group? A secret army? We need answers.\u201d",
    "In response, Minister Johnston Fernando said these motorcycles went around the country during the Covid-19 pandemic period as well, and no harm would come to the people.",
    "Meanwhile, MP Manusha Nanayakkara also raised concerns about the matter, stating that allowing such masked individuals to operate could only give birth to state-sponsored terrorism. \u201cThere was a group similar to this at the Mirihana protest. This is a very serious issue about security.\u00a0 They could assassinate MPs when they are heading out of the parliament. They could murder an innocent person and be gone because they did not show their faces.\u201d"
