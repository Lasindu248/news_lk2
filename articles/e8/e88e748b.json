    "Power cuts to be spread over two time slots for electricity consumers\u2019 convenience",
    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has denied to approve a seven-hour power cut for today as requested by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), but had approved less than five hours of load shedding.",
    "PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said the Commission has directed the CEB to impose today\u2019s power cuts over two time slots for consumer convenience.",
    "He said the original request of over seven hours load shedding was denied considering the availability of fuel and rain received to the catchment areas of the reservoirs.",
    "As per the PUCSL, electricity consumers could experience power cuts of three or four hours during the day and half-an-hour in the night before 10 p.m. today."
