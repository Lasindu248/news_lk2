    "In a bid to enhance efficiency in passenger handling, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved a pilot project on a digital gateway for outward travellers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).",
    "The Government said the Airport and Aviation (Lanka) Ltd. has been planning to execute several multiple extensions to enhance the effectiveness of the monitoring activities at the BIA based on the concept \u2018One Identity\u2019 which is also recognised by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).",
    "It is believed that the check on of the passengers will be an easy process to complete through confirming that they possess a valid digital passport for the identification of the passenger by installation of electronic door/face recognition machines at the access point of departure lounge.",
    "The proposal to this effect submitted by Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday."
