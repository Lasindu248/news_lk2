    "Therefore, the number of load shedding hours would be increased to 10 hours.",
    "Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department stated that inter-monsoon rain would be expected in the first week of April, but it could not predict whether rain water would be sufficient to fill the reservoirs. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
