    "The Fuel Distributors' Association (FDA) today claimed that there would be a lull in the distribution of diesel in the country until Saturday (28).",
    "A spokesman from the association told the Daily Mirror that nearly 6,000 MT of diesel is required for daily consumption, but currently it stands at approximately 2,400 MT.",
    "However, with the current situation, diesel is provided to the Railway Department, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), armed forces and other essential services, and nearly 500MT of diesel is being distributed to the fuel sheds around the country, he said.",
    "The association expressed its dissatisfaction, said though petrol is being distributed continuously, but not in a proper manner. Certain filling stations received nearly five thousand litres of petrol, but several filling stations do not receive at least one bowser load of fuel, he said.",
    "If it goes at this rate, the existing long queues for petrol will not end, the association added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
