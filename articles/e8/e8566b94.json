    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has called for the President and all the members of the Parliament to \u00a0arrive at a resolution to the present crises, as it has been noted that nobody has been appointed for the critical positions such as the Secretary to the Treasury, the Finance Minister and authorities for Ministries such as Power and Energy.",
    "BASL is strongly of the view that any solution to the present crisis has to be found within the framework of the democratic constitutional structure. Any solution outside the framework of the Constitution will\u00a0lack legitimacy and would be open to challenge within the legal system, a release by the BASL stated.",
