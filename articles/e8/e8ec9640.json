    "Launching a Ceylon Cinnamon promotion campaign, Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Mumbai made arrangements to offer five kgs of Ceylon Cinnamon to Lord Krishna at International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Juhu, Mumbai in the presence of temple President Brajhari Das and other resident monks on 16 May.",
    "During the ceremony, Consul General Dr. Valsan Vethody stated that Sri Lanka is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of pure cinnamon to the world and 90% of global cinnamon supply is done by Sri Lanka. \u2018Pure Ceylon Cinnamon\u2019 is a global brand in the international market and that Sri Lanka obtained GI certification for Ceylon cinnamon in the EU.",
    "Furthermore, the Consul General pointed out that Cinnamomum Zeylanicum is a tree indigenous to Sri Lanka which produces the highest-grade pure cinnamon. Cinnamon grown and produced in Sri Lanka enjoys a long-standing reputation in the international market due to its unique quality, colour, flavour and aroma.",
    "Even though cinnamon is an essential spice in Indian cuisine, most of the consumers in Mumbai buy Cassia variety due to unawareness of the difference between true cinnamon and cassia and non-availability of Ceylon cinnamon in Mumbai market. Mission\u2019s cinnamon promotional efforts are geared towards changing the current situation to create demand for cinnamon products from Sri Lanka."
