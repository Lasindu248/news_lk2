    "One of the sacked ministers, MP Udaya Gammanpila has been denied permission to speak in a Parliament debate on energy crisis on March 10.",
    "Raising the matter on Twitter, the former energy Minister said he had made a written request on March 7 seeking a time slot since he was expelled from the position; however, the Office of the Chief\u00a0 Government Whip had informed him that he was not permitted to speak.",
    "Subsequently, MP Gammanpila approached Chief Government Whip Minister Johnston Fernando who had replied him saying \u201cLet\u2019s see\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe Office of Government Whip informed me that I would not be allowed to speak since the list was full, despite I had been the minister of energy until March 3. I have already complained to the speaker seeking justice for me,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI have been elected to parliament on SLPP ticket by people casting 136,331 votes. Denying my right to speak in Parliament by SLPP means denying my voters to express their hearts and minds.\u00a0 I respectfully expect the speaker to protect my right to speak in Parliament,\u201d MP Udaya Gammanpila added.
