    "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has directed the Department of External Resources to prepare a specific 10-year Economic Development Plan aimed at the economic development of the country and to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the same.",
    "These instructions were given at the COPA meeting in Parliament recently under the chairmanship of Prof. Tissa Vitharana, according to the Parliament media unit.",
    "The Director General of the Department of External Resources said that despite the change in political authority, there should be a specific 10-year development plan that will not change, in order to build the country\u2019s economy. He also pointed out that this plan should be presented to Parliament and approval obtained.",
    "The Members of Parliament who participated in this Committee pointed out that this is the best time to formulate such a national plan so that it can function without the influence of any political authority.",
    "Officials who were present during the discussion pointed out that some of the development projects were halted due to the decisions of the executive. If there is no mechanism to involve and advise officials on such matters, the COPA will provide the necessary support to make the necessary policy decisions to formulate it.\u00a0 (Yohan Perera)"
