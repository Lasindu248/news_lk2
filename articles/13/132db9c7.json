    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s dairy farms are hit by foreign exchange shortages with feed, medicine, and vitamin supplies disrupted and costs rising, an industry association said.",
    "\u201cProper micronutrients and vitamins from the quality feed is an essential part of our industry as the animals play an integral role in the supply chain,\u201d Binesh Pananwala, President of All Island Dairy Association (AIDA) said in a statement.",
    "\u201cIt is imperative that feed such as maize and silage is readily available as it would greatly assist in sustaining the industry.",
    "However, he said the dependency on imports for these commodities and the import ban due to the forex crisis is crippling the industry.\u201d",
    "AIDA calls for immediate action to prioritize the importation of raw materials to sustain the industry.",
    "\u201c\u2026we are unable to meet the demand for fresh milk and powdered milk. Our production has reduced a great deal already and if not rectified, will spell disaster going forward,\u201d A.C.H Munaweera, Consultant and General Manager of AIDA said.",
    "The organization also said that if the feed does not meet proper nutritional standards, it will affect the health of over 900,000 animals.",
    "Other issues include spare parts to operate dairy processing plants and chilling tanks.",
    "AIDA says if spare parts aren\u2019t imported within the next few weeks they will be compelled to stop production altogether."
