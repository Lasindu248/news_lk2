    "Former CEBEU President Saumya Kumarwadu said under competitive tendering a wind plant could be built to sell power at 4 cents a unit or below.",
    "\u201c7.55 cents is about twice the price,\u201d he said. \u201cOver 25 years that is about 4 billion US dollars.\u201d",
    "Foreign direct investments coming into renewable energy are called \u2018market seeking\u2019 investments rather than export oriented industries and services which are called efficiency seeking investments.",
    "Chairman of state-run Ceylon Electricity Board, M M C Ferdinando defended the move saying the Adani deal came through the government and memorandum of agreement was signed with the Finance Ministry, the Board of Investment, the CEB and Adani group.",
