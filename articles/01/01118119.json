    "SJB MP, Harin Fernando has informed party leader Sajith Premadasa that he will sit independently in Parliament as Premadasa had failed to give a possible solution to solve the ongoing crisis in the country.",
    "Fernando told Daily Mirror that\u00a0 the SJB members had held discussions throughout the day but no possible solutions had been reached to sort the ongoing issues, and Premadasa had refused the Premiership post till such time some conditions are not met.",
    "\"I told Sajith this is not the time to put forward conditions.We should be thinking of the country first and how we can reach political stability. He should have taken the Premiership and then worked out the conditions after solving the economic crisis and brining normalcy to the people. However he failed to do that,\" Fernando said.",
    "He further said that he will support the new government that is appointed as he believed in first reaching a solution for the people.",
    "Fernando also hinted at a possible split in the SJB saying he was not alone and there were more who were with him and these numbers would be seen when the votes get underway in Parliament. (Jamila Husain)"
