  "body_lines": [
    "The All Island School Van Operators' Association (AISVOA) today said that they are compelled to increase the school van fares by Rs.1,000 as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has increased its prices from last night.",
    "They said they face numerous difficulties in continuing their service due to the absence of diesel. We have to stay in the queues for a longer period of time to refuel, which is a waste of valuable time.",
    "\"With the previous fuel price increase by the CPC, we have decided not to increase the school van fare, but it is very unfortunate to say that the school van operators are now under a huge burden. It is not fair to pass that burden to the parents, but in reality, we do not have any other alternative, but to increase the charges,\" he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
