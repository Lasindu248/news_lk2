    "The Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) has asked people to file complaints with them immediately if their foreign employment is more than three months late, according to SLFEB Deputy General Manager Mangala Randeniya.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that if any foreign agency promise foreign jobs, that should be provided within three months. If not, people have the authority to make complaints against such foreign employment agencies.",
    "The Daily Mirror reliably learns that several foreign employment agencies have registered with the SLFEB but not receiving job quotas used to post advertisements on social media saying there are jobs to fill urgently.They mostly use their SLFEB Labour Licence Number to show them they are genuine.",
    "Those forged agencies used to collect money from people and deposit it in their fixed deposit accounts or used to\u00a0 invest them. The people who registered with them kept waiting for nearly six months. This practice has become widespread after the COVID-19 pandemic, the information revealed.",
    "Therefore, the SLFEB requested people to be vigilant when searching for foreign job agencies and ensure they are registered with them or not, before getting into mess. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
