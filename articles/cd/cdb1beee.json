    "\u201cThe G7 stands ready to support the Paris Club\u2019s efforts, in line with its principles, to address the need for a debt treatment for Sri Lanka,\u201d they said, referring to the group of mostly rich creditor nations.",
    "The draft statement, which is to be finalised before the end the G7finance ministers\u2019 meeting on Friday, also called on other big creditor nations not in the Paris Club to coordinate with the group and urged them to provide debt relief on comparable terms.",
    "G7 finance chiefs also singled out China, which has become a major creditor to low-income countries, to actively contribute to debt relief for such countries.",
