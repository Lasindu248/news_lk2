    "This year, the Bank\u2019s Annual Report is presented around the theme, Designed to Excel \u2013 supported by a decorative motif of Tetris symbolizing the building blocks of a digital landscape. Discussing DFCC Bank\u2019s stakeholder-centric, digital-first reporting philosophy, Senior Vice President / Chief Financial Officer, Chinthika Amarasekara Said, \u201cBuilding on our efforts to better empower our stakeholders with easy and efficient access to information, the PDF version of our Annual Report for 2021 was published in landscape orientation for the first time. This decision was driven by our data gathering and analytics, which discovered that the vast majority of stakeholders viewing our reports in this format did so using a tablet or desktop computer in landscape mode. Our digital-first approach has received an excellent reception from our stakeholder community, with less than 10% of our 10,000+ shareholders, now requesting for a CD or printed publication by regular mail. This approach has also enabled us to ensure that the publication and distribution of our reports has remained carbon-neutral for over a decade, reducing our reliance on paper and logistics networks, while also delivering significant cost and time efficiencies to all.\u201d",
