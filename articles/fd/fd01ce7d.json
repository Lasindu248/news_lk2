    "All parties should support the proposed 21st amendment which will curtail presidential powers as that is what the general public and those who are staging continuous protests are requesting for, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said today.",
    "Speaking to some professionals at the Prime Minister\u2019s office, Mr. Wijewardene said political parties are welcome to come up with amendments. \u201cThe Prime Minister promised an all-party meeting on Friday to allow them to come up with appropriate amendments to the legislation.",
    "\u201cAll parties should support this endeavour to curtail powers of the President as that is what the general public and those at GotaGogama and Nodealgama want. One should not come up with issues saying proposals made by different groups have been eliminated,\u201d Mr. Wijewardene said.",
    "Referring to the fuel price hike, the UNP Deputy Leader said the prices were increased as the country's financial situation had gone down to low levels. \u201cThe fuel price hike was recommended by the Central government and this had to be heeded as the county\u2019s economic situation has gone down to its lowest level. \u201cThe Prime Minister has already promised concessions in a new budget and it will be done,\u201d he said.(Yohan Perera)"
