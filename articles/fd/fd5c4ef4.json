The interaction is expected to strengthen the Indo-Sri Lankan partnership and encourage joint acoustic capacity and capability building at the regional level.",
    "The broad strategic relevance of this high-level dialogue entails that the participants get exposed to policy issues, technological means, innovative tools and measures, geopolitics, organisational aspects both nationally and globally, regional and global frameworks, and more. While having security overtones, the webinar has included representatives of the private sector and technology to give it a clear perspective on the subject.",
    "The webinar on 25 March is being held ahead of the BIMSTEC Heads of State Summit (31 March) in Colombo. In consideration of Sri Lanka\u2019s importance to the UDA/MDA, this webinar is expected to be the first of many similar activities on the subject planned for the future.",
