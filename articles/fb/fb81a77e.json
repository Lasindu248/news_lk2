    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 If strikes continue in Sri Lanka, it could severely impact the already battered and shrinking economy of the country, top economists said after over a thousand unions took part in a one-day token strike around the island on Thursday (28).",
    "EconomyNext spoke to a number of experts on the effect of Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing wave of protests and Thursday\u2019s massive trade union campaign.",
    "Though they were unable to put a number on the strike\u2019s cost on the economy, they agreed that its multiplier effects are tremendous and will be crippling if it continues. Thursday\u2019s strike brought the country to a virtual standstill as unions representing various sectors took time out to protest and demand that the government resign.",
    "Unions have threatened to go for a continuous strike or a total shutdown if the government does not abide by its demand. Banking staff also joined the strike.",
    "\u201cThe bank employees union joined the protests on Thursday, and many bank back-office operations were short staffed which would impact the lives of citizens,\u201d Murtaza Jafferjee, Chairperson of Advocata, a Colombo-based think-tank, said.",
    "Jafferjee told EconomyNext that he himself was affected by a delay in a payment he had made earler in the day. \u201cMy predicament would have been experienced by thousands if not hundreds of thousands of individuals in the economy,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt is disrupting economic activities and the well-being of citizens by compounding scarcities, shortages, and high prices.\u201d",
    "At least 70 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s labour force is made of daily wage earners and the rest on fixed income monthly salaries.",
    "Noting that most daily wage earners, who engage in rural agriculture sectors, are unlikely to be affected by a demonstration in cities, Jafferjee said if cities get disrupted then there will be cascading effect in rural parts of the country too.",
    "Expressingg similar views, Prof Sirimal Abeyratne explained that Sri Lanka\u2019s economy was already shrinking and the protests will only add more to it.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is in a multifaceted crisis. When an economy in a crisis situation, it shrinks; but ours has been shrinking for a while now,\u201d said Abeyratne.",
    "\u201cWhen we restrict imports, inputs and then restrict energy \u2014 those are essential for the economy to grow. We are multiplying its shrinking but added to that we have the strikes, which will add more to the declining economy due to multiplier effects.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is going through the worst economic crisis in the country\u2019s post-Independence history, leading to unprecedented public protests against the government.",
    "The two economists said the country will have to go through even tougher times before it recovers as the damage is already severe. (Colombo/Apr29/2022)"
