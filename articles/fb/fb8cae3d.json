    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has extended an olive branch to the country\u2019s main opposition to work together on addressing the shortage of drugs.",
    "While commending the Samamgi Jana Balavegaya\u2019s \u2018Husma (Breath)\u2019 program, the Prime Minister requested the SJB to take measures to import a particular drug that is in short supply in the country.",
    "Responding to the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa said the SJBs \u2018Husma (Breath)\u2019 program primarily focuses on life-saving hospital equipment.",
    "However, he requested the Prime Minister to name the drug, and the SJB is willing to look into any possibility.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the funds to provide the whole country while being in the opposition. But as much as possible we will try to provide the important life-saving medicines,\u201d he told the Parliament.",
    "Further responding to the Prime Minister, Premadasa said \u201cWe don\u2019t spend 24/7, 365 marginalizing you. We actually want to incorporate you. Since you are just an individual in the Parliament, you have been a former Prime Minister several times over, and you were my political leader when I was in the United National Party. One thing my father has taught is to respect leaders, unlike many who have a distaste for you. I don\u2019t want to marginalize you.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese are all SLFPers who left the UNP,\u201d the Prime Minister jokingly replied pointing at the ruling faction, while adding he will incorporate them first to the UNP, and then get the opposition leader back.",
