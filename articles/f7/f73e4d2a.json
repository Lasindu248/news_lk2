    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka is aware of the latest COVID-19 situation in China and elsewhere in the world and adequate measures will be taken by the health authorities depending on changes in the global situation, an official said.",
    "Director of the Health Promotion Bureau Dr Ranjith Batuwanthudawa told EconomyNext on Monday (21) that developments in China are being monitored and, at present, there is no immediate cause for alarm in Sri Lanka.",
    "Chinese authorities detected over 4,000 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday (20), mainly in the northeastern Jilin province where China has imposed restrictions to control the new wave of the virus.",
    "After more than a year, China also reported two COVID-19 deaths also from the Jilin province on Saturday (19).",
    "Authorities have informed the province will be under tight lockdown for three days from Sunday to control the situation.",
    "On March 21, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China said 2,027 new cases were confirmed in mainland China.",
    "China imposed travel restrictions on Monday (21) in provinces and cities nationwide, though travel restrictions imposed in the Shenzhen city have now been relaxed, with business activities given permission to resume in the city.",
    "\u201cThe epidemiology unit of the Ministry of Health is constantly monitoring the situation in China,\u201d Dr Batuwanthudawa said.",
    "\u201cCases are gradually increasing in China, but there is no alarming situation for Sri Lanka at the moment. We are always on alert about the global situation and the epidemiology unit will take adequate measures if the situation changes with time,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently facing a downward trend in new COVID-19 cases, with only 236 new infections being identified on Sunday (20), bringing the total number of cases to 658,197.",
    "With five COVID related deaths being confirmed on Sunday, the death toll from the epidemic has increased to 16,437.",
    "On a global level, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that, after a consistent decrease since the end of January 2022, the number of new weekly cases increased by 8 percent during the week of March 07 through 13.",
    "The number of new deaths continued a decreasing trend recording a 17 percent decrease compared to the previous week.",
    "Across the six WHO regions, over 11 million new cases and just over 43,000 new deaths were reported.",
    "\u201cAs of 13 March 2022, over 455 million confirmed cases and over six million deaths have been reported globally. At the regional level, the Western Pacific Region, the African Region and the European Region reported increases in new weekly cases of 29 percent, 12 percent and 2 percent, respectively, as compared to the previous week, while the Eastern Mediterranean Region reported a decrease of 24 percent, the South-East Asia Region reported a decrease of 21 percent and the Region of the Americas reported a decrease of 20 percent compared to the previous week.\u201d",
    "The WHO said, during the last six months, a significant decline in the circulation of the VOCs Alpha, Beta and Gamma has been observed in all six WHO regions. Over the past 90 days, few to no sequences of these variants have been reported.",
    "Media reports citing the WHO said the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) as per discussion held in early March the classification of VOCs and VOIs remains unchanged. However, VOCs and VOIs will further be designated as either \u2018currently circulating\u2019 or \u2018previously circulating\u2019 depending on current epidemiological trends.",
    "\u201cOn March 9, 2022, on the advice of the TAG-VE, WHO designated Alpha, Beta and Gamma as \u2018previously circulating VOCs\u2019 and Delta and Omicron as \u2018currently circulating VOCs\u2019,\u201d the WHO said.",
    "It further said, Lambda, first detected in Peru in December 2020, and Mu, first detected in Colombia in January 2021, were designated as \u2018previously circulating VOIs\u2019 on March 09 onwards as their prevalence has declined significantly over the last year, with no circulation reported during the past 90 days in any of the six WHO regions.",
    "\u201cMember States should continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants, including current and previously circulating VOCs and VOIs, and flag any observed upsurge of cases linked to these variants,\u201d WHO said.",
    "\u201cThe designation from currently circulating VOC or VOI to previously circulating VOC or VOI reflects the declined circulation of the variant but does not exclude the possibility of a future upsurge of this variant.\u201d (Colombo/Mar21/2022)"
