    "ISLAMABAD, AFP: A Pakistan court Monday sentenced six men to death and dozens more to jail terms ranging from two years to life for the brutal mob slaying of a Sri Lankan factory manager accused of blasphemy.",
    "The vigilante attack in Sialkot last 3 December caused outrage, with then Prime Minister Imran Khan calling it a \u201cday of shame for Pakistan\u201d.",
    "Few issues are as galvanising in Pakistan as blasphemy, and even the slightest suggestion of an insult to Islam can supercharge protests and incite lynchings.",
    "On Monday, prosecutors said 88 of 89 people on trial for the murder of Priyantha Diyawadana had been convicted, with six sentenced to death, nine to life in prison and the rest jail terms ranging from two to five years.",
    "\u201cThe prosecution team worked very hard to present its case to the court and to reach this judgement,\u201d the lead public prosecutor Abdul Rauf Wattoo, told AFP. \u201cWe are satisfied with the outcome.\u201d The trial was overseen by a special anti-terror court, established to speed up justice in high profile cases that can otherwise spend years being processed.",
    "At the time of the killing, local police officials told AFP that rumours spread that Diyawadana had torn down a religious poster and thrown it in the dustbin. Several gruesome video clips shared on social media showed a mob beating the prone victim while chanting slogans against blasphemy. Other clips showed Diyawadana\u2019s body set ablaze. Many in the mob made no attempt to hide their identity and some took selfies in front of the burning corpse."
