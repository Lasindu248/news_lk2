  "body_lines": [
    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has requested the President to revoke the proclamation declaring a state of emergency to ensure that the fundamental rights of the people such as the freedom of expression, freedom of speech, publication and the freedom of peaceful assembly are protected.",
    "The BASL re-iterated that the state of emergency must not be used to stifle peaceful protests and dissent or to make arbitrary arrests and detentions. In a statement, the BASL said it has gravely concerned about the declaration of a state of emergency by the President with effect from midnight on the 6th of May 2022.",
    "The BASL observed that a declaration of a state of emergency is not the answer to the present situation in the country including the spate of public protests and strikes which have occurred.",
    "The BASL also reiterated that the protests in turn must not be violent and must remain peaceful at all times. Meanwhile, the BASL has urged the President to forthwith explain to the people the reasons as to why he has declared the State of Emergency.",
    "The BASL also urged the people of the country to remain calm and to act in a peaceful manner so that their fundamental rights which form part of their intangible heritage remain protected.",
    "\"We appeal to all parties in both government and the opposition to recognize the grave crisis that is facing the country and its people and the urgent need to resolve the political impasse in the country,\" the BASL statement added.",
    "This statement had been issued under the signatures of BASL President Saliya Pieris PC and its Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
