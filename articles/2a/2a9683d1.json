    "In last week\u2019s article, I warned that the Depp case was not over even though the jury had sung. In February 2019, Johnny Depp sued his ex-wife Amber Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post in which she claimed to speak for women who had suffered intimate partner violence. Heard countersued Depp in August 2020, alleging that he had coordinated \u201ca harassment campaign\u201d.",
    "For Depp\u2019s lawsuit, on June 1, 2022, a jury in Fairfax Virginia found that all three statements from Heard\u2019s op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and were made with actual malice. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages from Heard. The punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by Virginia state law. Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp. In short, the jury believed Depp and thought Heard was lying.",
    "In their closing statements, Heard\u2019s principal lawyers Elaine Bredehoft and Ben Rottenborn called on the jury to send a message to abused women everywhere by supporting Heard\u2019s version. This was not an acceptable approach and should have been challenged by Depp\u2019s team. A jury is not Western Union. Its job is not to send messages but to decide on facts.",
    "After the trial was over, Bredehoft did a number of TV interviews in which she made the same point and also trod on dangerous ground for a working lawyer by implying that the jury had not followed instructions to avoid reading about the case and that the judge was biased.",
    "Throughout the proceedings the MSM (mainstream media) had taken the side of Heard because she was seen to be representative of abused women.",
    "The trial verdict was seen as a setback for the Me Too movement. I rejoiced at MeToo and noted that the legal system was capable of finding out the facts about Harvey Weinstein and convicting him. Despite the alleged widespread misogyny demonstrated by the Depp case, Weinstein is still in jail. Calling out a woman for being a liar is not misogyny.",
    "The Guardian\u2019s take on the case has been particularly egregious throughout. It has run a number of opinion pieces which were short on fact and heavy on generalisation. In an article headed \u201cAn orgy of misogyny\u201d, Moira Donegan wrote: \u201cThe strange, illogical, and unjust ruling has the effect of sanctioning Depp\u2019s alleged abuse of Heard, and of punishing Heard for speaking about it. It will have a devastating effect on survivors, who will be silenced, now, with the knowledge that they cannot speak about their violent experiences at men\u2019s hands without the threat of a ruinous libel suit. In that sense, women\u2019s speech just became a lot less free.\u201d",
    "It is no longer \u201calleged abuse\u201d. It is no longer abuse. A Guardian editorial said, \u201cThere is a risk that, in future, other women who wish to speak or write about domestic abuse may be deterred by the fear of being sued by former partners.\u201d",
    "The MSM in general are proving to be sore losers. Even the Washington Post, which published the defamatory article in the first place, is showing no contrition for getting it wrong. I have canceled my subscription. The view that one gets from the mainstream media is very different from what one gets from actually watching the proceedings and listening to YouTube discussions of the legal aspects. Someone who attended the court said there was no MSM there to report on it. The Washington Post has gone to war with social media.",
    "The Washington Post was the paper that found out the facts about Watergate and brought about President Nixon\u2019s resignation. The main lesson of that saga was that the cover up is usually more dangerous than the initial crime. When in a hole stop digging. The current iteration of the Post seems to have forgotten that lesson.",
    "Taylor Lorentz published an article in the Post which set out to demonize those on YouTube who were covering the case. There are practising and experienced attorneys who have channels on YouTube and have brought their knowledge and expertise to analysing the proceedings and explained legal technicalities to lay people. They started out as individuals but have formed a community and have been appearing on each other\u2019s channels. A British barrister is also contributing with his knowledge about the UK libel case against the Sun which Depp lost. He has started a petition to get that verdict overturned. There have been some fallings out in this community but generally they stick together and talk good sense.",
    "Lorentz\u2019s article was rather peculiar in that it mentioned some teenage Instagrammers that nobody had ever heard of. She quoted them as saying they made modest amounts of money from posting about the trial. Her main thrust was against two YouTubers whose work I have found useful. \u201cLegalBytes\u201d host Alyte Mazeika is a lawyer and she has chaired many discussions involving other lawyers. TUG (That Umbrella Guy) is a mental health professional who has been investigating the Depp case for about six years and has come up with a wealth of information of which the MSM knows nothing.",
    "Lorentz claimed in her article that she had reached out to those two for comment but they had not responded. They were able to prove that she was lying. The Post stealth-edited the erroneous claim from Lorenz\u2019s report, though it remains unclear whether she herself removed the claim or an editor did the needful.\u00a0I will not bore you with the numerous confusing corrections that have subsequently been made.",
    "Lorenz\u2019s main gripe was that YouTube \u201ccontent creators\u201d benefited from the courtroom frenzy by increasing their audience and making money.\u00a0Lorenz alleged that according to Business Insider, Mazeika \u201cearned $5,000 in one week by pivoting the content on her YouTube channel to nonstop trial coverage and analysis.\u201d She also claimed that ThatUmbrellaGuy \u201cearned up to $80,000 last month, according to an estimate by social analytics firm Social Blade.\u201d",
    "TUG responded: \u201cThe Washington Post also FLAGRANTLY misrepresented my earnings report and needs to correct it. Social Blade says I made between $4.9k and $79.1k. They ADDED TO the highest estimate, over-reporting for dramatic effect.\u201d It is ironic that what has come to be called the legacy press is whining about YouTubers monetizing content when there are ads all over MSM and the paper is owned by possibly the richest man on earth, Jeff Bezos. The YouTubers have got their hands dirty by actually digging out facts and some have queued up under gruelling conditions to attend the court. The MSM has not bothered to attend.",
    "I will sum up with a few facts that the MSM are ignoring. Those who complain about the noise of the trial do not know the facts. Elaine Bredehoft said the trial should not have been televised but being televised meant that millions were watching and deciding whether Heard was credible. Millions will lose their trust in media if the MSM tell millions that they are mistaken. A majority of people watching the trial were female.",
    "I have read thousands of comment on YouTube and overwhelmingly the females, especially those who identify as abuse victims, despise Heard. Initially, Amber was believed. The allegations were treated seriously and investigated but were found wanting. Depp\u2019s case was an uphill struggle but many who doubted him at the beginning ended up believing him. Many have taken the line, \u201cWe did support Amber and she played us.\u201d",
    "A lot of people will mistrust the MSM after this. You think they are doing real journalism but they have let you down",
