    "*Moves are now underway to collect signatures from other opposition parties as well",
    "Tamil National Alliance Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran has prepared a No-Confidence Motion against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, which will be submitted to Parliament when the House convenes next.",
    "The Daily Mirror learns that the UNP has already expressed its support for this motion and moves are now underway to collect signatures from other opposition parties as well. If 113 signatures are collected on the NCM, there will be no legality to remove the President but this will clearly show that the Parliament has lost the trust in the President, which will further pressurize Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign.",
    "Senior sources said that in the event the President resigns, Parliament will then appoint a new President - a candidate who they will believe is the most suitable for the position. The Daily Mirror learns that even the JVP is likely to sign this NCM against the President and SLPP MPs are also being approached.",
    "Senior sources said the 11 party alliance members including Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila will be approached to sign the NCM, as Wimal Weerawansa was one of the first to publicly say he will not accept any portfolio under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The Daily Mirror learns that the NCM against the Prime Minister which was initiated by the opposition SJB has failed to get the required numbers and even though MPs such as Gammanpila are voicing for it with the ruling parliamentarians, the signatures are yet to be placed on paper.
