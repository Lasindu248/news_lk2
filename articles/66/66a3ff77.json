    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress (CWC), which largely represents minority Tamils of Indian origin \u2014 many of whom work in the plantation sector \u2014 have decided to vote against the incumbent government in the event of a no confidence motion, CWC general secretary Jeevan Thondaman said.",
    "\u201cCeylon Workers\u2019 Congress, after extensive discussions, has collectively taken a decision to vote against the present government. The decision has been communicated to the party leaders of the ruling party, the opposition and the independents,\u201d Thondaman tweeted Monday (25) morning.",
    "Previously, the party had decided to abstain in a vote against the government due to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) not intimating to the CWC what their roadmap for a way out of the twin economic and political crisis Sri Lanka is facing. In case no party or coalition can show simple majority, Thondaman tweeted on April 17, the question arises on how to proceed.",
    "\u201cThe CWC is not the only party as there are other parties that share the similar view and are seeking answers from the opposition. I do understand that as a long standing organisation, the CWC does have a principle of neutrality but I, personally, believe that circumstances must be taken into account and a collective and sensible decision is necessary which is why we have called for a party meeting where all views will be shared, discussed and, hopefully, the right decision is taken,\u201d he said on April 17. (Colombo/Apr25/2022)"
