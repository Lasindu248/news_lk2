    "Even if the President leaves tomorrow, we cannot go for a presidential election. All that could be done is for the Parliament to appoint a President, Environment Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.",
    "He said even under the powers vested upon the President, he would not have the power to dissolve the government at any time. Therefore, it is not an easy task to shout for a change of power, he said.",
    "After the death of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, no election was held and no President was appointed. Instead, Parliament voted in favour of D. B. Wijetunga who was subsequently appointed as President. According to the constitution, there is a time to take power. It is not practical that a government that does not exist, could be replaced and a new regime could take over, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
