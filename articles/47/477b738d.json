  "body_lines": [
    "(CNN) The UK is to send 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine, Downing Street announced Saturday, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid an in-person visit to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
    "Johnson and Austria\u2019s Chancellor Karl Nehammer made separate visits to Zelensky on Saturday, the latest in a string of leaders to travel to the country during the ongoing Russian invasion.",
    "A photograph tweeted by Ukraine\u2019s Embassy to the UK showed Johnson seated opposite Zelensky at a table in a pink and green stuccoed room. The post was captioned with the word \u201cSurprise\u201d and a winking face emoji.",
    "The Press Service of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said on its official Twitter account that the two leaders had held talks in Kyiv, posting several photographs of the pair\u2019s previously unannounced meeting.",
    "Johnson posted on Twitter that his visit to Kyiv was \u201ca show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine\u201d and announced a new package of financial and military aid.",
    "\u201cUkraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,\u201d the UK PM said in a statement.",
    "He praised Zelensky\u2019s \u201cresolute leadership\u201d and the \u201cinvincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people,\u201d adding that the UK \u201cstands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight ... we are in it for the long run.\u201d",
    "Later in his nightly address posted on social media, Zelensky thanked the UK and Johnson.",
    "\u201cBoris was among those who didn\u2019t doubt for a minute whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of Great Britain in providing our country help in defense, and also leadership in the sanctions policy, will always be in history.",
    "\u201cUkraine will always be grateful for this to Boris and Britain,\u201d Zelensky said.",
    "During the press conference, Johnson said the UK will continue to intensify sanctions against Russia. Johnson also said Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions have dealt a \u201ccrushing blow\u201d to his reputation and the Russian government.",
    "\u201cWe will influence Russia\u2019s ability to use its energy resources,\u201d he added. \u201cThe war determines the vision of Ukraine\u2019s future, so our partners and I will supply Ukraine with equipment, technology, intelligence so that Ukraine never faces the horrors of invasion and blackmail.\u201d",
    "Following the meeting, Downing Street said the UK government would provide armored vehicles and anti-ship missile systems, \u201cin addition to the \u00a3100 million worth of high-grade military equipment\u201d announced on Friday.",
    "Zelensky and Nehammer\u2019s meeting was separate to the one with Johnson and happened earlier on Saturday, according to Zelensky\u2019s official Telegram channel.",
    "While several other leaders have visited Ukraine in recent weeks, the trip by Nehammer is significant given his country\u2019s neutral status, which is enshrined in its constitution.",
    "Austria is not part of NATO and does not supply weapons to Ukraine. It has, however, provided Ukraine with humanitarian aid and helmets and protection vests for civilian use, according to a statement from the Austrian Chancellery.",
    "Nehammer said Saturday that while his country is militarily neutral, \u201cWe understand we have to help where injustice and war crimes take place.\u201d",
    "According to his office, Nehammer was set to meet with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, before returning to Austria on Saturday evening.",
    "Nehammer was also due to visit the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, which endured five weeks of near-constant firefights; after Russian forces withdrew from the town, the bodies of at least 20 civilians were found lying in one street, some with their hands tied.",
    "\u201cWe have to make those war crimes known to the UN, and international justice must begin investigating and fight these crimes,\u201d he said during a news conference with Zelensky.",
    "The twin visits by Johnson and Nehammer came a day after top European Union officials made a trip to Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Josep Borrell, the bloc\u2019s top diplomat, visited Kyiv and Bucha on Friday, alongside Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger.",
    "During the visit, von der Leyen ceremoniously handed Zelensky an EU questionnaire to complete -- a symbolic, but important step towards Ukraine\u2019s membership of the bloc. Tweeting about the move, von der Leyen said: \u201cWe will accelerate this process as much as we can, while ensuring that all conditions are respected.\u201d",
    "The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia visited Kyiv last month, at a time when it was still regularly targeted by Russian strikes. Like Johnson\u2019s visit on Saturday, that trip was kept secret until the three leaders were in the country, traveling on a train from eastern Ukraine."
