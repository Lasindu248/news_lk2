    "John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) has signed an agreement with Hemas Consumer Brands to offer all female employees of the John Keells Group with the \u2018Fems Aya\u2019 sanitary napkins, free of charge, going forward.",
    "Menstrual health is a highly stigmatised topic, and the lack of education on menstrual health and limited access to essential sanitation, may have a negative impact on not only the physical and mental wellbeing of individuals but also the productivity of females in the workforce. This facility is launched in line with the Group\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEandI) initiatives, under the brand \u2018ONE JKH\u2019. The partnership also provides a series of awareness sessions on menstrual health by Hemas with the aim of reducing health risks and anxiety related to menstruation.",
    "JKH Chairman Krishan Balendra said: \u201cAs part of our ONE JKH initiative, this \u2018SanNap\u2019 program, is aimed not only to advocate the prioritisation and de-stigmatisation of menstrual health, but also to recognise that it is a basic necessity for all females, including our workforce. While providing sanitary napkins free of charge for all female employees, is the first phase of the SanNap program, the second phase will include extending the facility to all employees who wish to offer their allotment to a female family member, thereby further increasing awareness and supporting the extended John Keells family.\u201d",
    "Hemas Consumer Brands Managing Director Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne said: \u201cA year ago Hemas Consumer through Fems Aya launched a Multi-Partner initiative for the first time in Sri Lanka and set out to train and educate women across Sri Lanka on menstrual health and hygiene and give access to an affordable sanitary napkin. The program has already touched thousands of lives and today we are excited about our partnership with John Keells and their phenomenal commitment to advance this cause. Hemas Consumer is the leading Sri Lankan Home and Personal Care company that is loved by Sri Lankans for enriching the lives of consumers through strong purpose-led brands, and for being a leading caretaker of Sri Lanka through progressive sustainability practices which lead to protect all that is endemic in the country.\u201d"
