    "(News 1st); Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday accused the United States of meddling in Pakistan\u2019s politics \u2014 a claim quickly denied by Washington \u2014 as a debate on a no-confidence motion against him in parliament was postponed.",
    "No Pakistan premier has ever seen out a full term, and Khan is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since being elected in 2018, with opponents accusing him of economic mismanagement and foreign-policy bungling.",
    "The government is also battling to contain a rise in militancy by the Pakistan Taliban, which on Wednesday announced an offensive against security forces during Ramadan, due to begin within days with the sighting of the next new moon.",
    "Fighting for his political life, Khan addressed the nation late Thursday, appearing to blunder when he named the United States as the origin of a \u201cmessage\u201d he said showed meddling in Pakistan\u2019s affairs.",
    "\u201cAmerica has \u2014 oh, not America but a foreign country I can\u2019t name. I mean from a foreign country, we received a message,\u201d he said.",
    "Local media have reported the message was in a briefing letter from Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to Washington recording a senior US official telling him they felt relations would be better if Khan left office.",
    "\u201cThey say that \u2018our anger will vanish if Imran Khan loses this no-confidence vote\u2019,\u201d he said.",
    "In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the allegations.",
    "We respect (and) we support Pakistan\u2019s constitutional process and the rule of law,\u201d Price said.",
    "Khan first raised the issue Sunday \u2014 citing an unnamed \u201cforeign power\u201d \u2014 at a huge rally of his supporters in the capital, Islamabad, capping weeks of political turmoil since the opposition raised the idea of a no-confidence vote.",
    "He has long complained that Pakistan was asked to sacrifice too much in joining Washington\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d, launched in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, with too little recognition or reward.",
    "\u201cHas anyone said \u2018thank you Pakistan\u2019 for what we did?\u201d he asked in Thursday\u2019s address.",
    "Khan spoke off-the-cuff for around 45 minutes, touching on several favourite topics including his efforts to get Islamophobia recognised as a global threat, and charting an independent path for Pakistan on the world stage.",
    "Khan raised Western ire by visiting Moscow the day Russia invaded Ukraine, but he defended the trip, saying: \u201cEven European leaders went to Russia, but Pakistan in particular is asked \u2018why did you go\u2019 as if we are their servants.\u201d",
    "Debate on the no-confidence motion was due to start Thursday, but the deputy speaker \u2014 from Khan\u2019s party \u2014 suspended proceedings when legislators declined to first address other items on the agenda.",
    "\u201cThe deputy speaker has once again dishonoured the parliamentary norms by not allowing the agenda item for a debate,\u201d opposition leader Shahbaz Sharif, tipped to replace Khan if he goes, told reporters.",
    "Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) effectively lost its majority in the 342-member National Assembly Wednesday when a coalition partner said its seven lawmakers would vote with the opposition.",
    "More than a dozen PTI lawmakers have also indicated they will cross the floor, although party leaders are trying to get the courts to prevent them from voting.",
    "In the past, parties have resorted to physically preventing lawmakers from voting on key legislation by blocking access to the national assembly, leading to cat-and-mouse chases and even accusations of kidnapping.",
    "The opposition is headed by the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) and the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) \u2014 two usually feuding dynastic groups that dominated national politics for decades until Khan forged a coalition against them.",
    "He was elected after promising to sweep away decades of entrenched corruption and cronyism, but has struggled to maintain support with inflation skyrocketing, a feeble rupee and crippling debt.",
    "Some analysts say Khan has also lost the crucial support of the military \u2014 claims both sides deny \u2014 and Pakistan\u2019s army is key to political power.",
    "There have been four military coups \u2014 and at least as many unsuccessful ones \u2014 since independence in 1947, and the country has spent more than three decades under army rule.",
    "Khan, a former international cricket star who in 1992 captained Pakistan to their only World Cup win, insisted he would never resign.",
    "\u201cI fight till the very last ball. I never quit whatever the result may be,\u201d he said.",
