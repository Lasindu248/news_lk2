    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The United States of America has expressed concern over the deployment of the military in Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe underscore, we stress that peaceful protesters should never be subject to violence or intimidation, whether that\u2019s on the part of a military force or civilian unit,\u201d said Ned Price, the US State Department Spokesperson on Tuesday (10).",
    "\u201cMore broadly, we\u2019re deeply concerned by reports of escalating violence in Sri Lanka over the past few days. We condemn, as I said before, violence against peaceful protesters. We call for a full investigation, arrests, and prosecution of anyone instigating and involved in acts of violence. We are, as I said before, also closely monitoring the deployment of troops, something that is of concern to us, and we\u2019re also closely following political developments and the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka after the resignation of the prime minister,\u201d he added.",
    "The US State Department urged the government and political leaders to work quickly to ensure public safety and work together to identify and implement solutions to achieve long-term economic and political stability in Sri Lanka.",
    "The government must address the Sri Lankan people\u2019s discontent over the economic crisis, including power, food, and medicine shortages, as well as their concerns about the political future of their country, he added."
