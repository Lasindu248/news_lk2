    "A crude oil tanker has been anchored at sea off the Colombo Port for more than a week due to the government's failure to pay for a crude oil tanker imported by the Ministry of Energy, informed sources said.",
    "It is reported that if the ship is unloaded after paying the amount, the fuel and electricity problem will be alleviated to some extent and the government is currently in the process of raising dollars to release it."
