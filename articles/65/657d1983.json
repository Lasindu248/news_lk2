    "Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the no-confidence motion against the government was delayed following a request made by him.",
    "He said this when Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena asked as to why the opposition didn't bring in the no-confidence motion against the government as planned earlier.",
    "\"The opposition said that they would bring in the no-confidence motion against the government. It is Friday today. Why it is not presented as said?,\" he asked.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe said that it was absurd brining in the no-confidence motion before the speech of the finance minister who is in Washington to engaged in discussions with the IMF.",
    "\"I requested to delay the NCM. It would serve no purpose brining in the NCM before the Finance Minister's speech. We can get together and discuss what should be done after his speech,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
