  "body_lines": [
    "(News 1st); Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan is facing arguably the biggest challenge of his political career, as the opposition seeks to remove him from office in a vote of no confidence.",
    "The country\u2019s lawmakers will convene on Thursday (31) to begin debating the motion as Mr Khan\u2019s future appears to be hanging by a thread.",
    "In recent days there has been a flurry of activity \u2013 and what some argue were tactics straight out of Machiavelli\u2019s playbook \u2013 which resulted in several Khan allies deserting his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, tilting the scales firmly in the opposition\u2019s favour.",
    "A simple majority of 172 in the 342-seat National Assembly against the former cricket legend would cut short his tenure as PM On Wednesday, the magic number was breached when his main coalition ally, the MQM, joined the opposition.",
    "It means on paper the opposition now commands 175 votes to the government\u2019s 164.",
    "Thundering against his arch-rivals \u2013 three-time premier Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari, husband of the murdered PM Benazir Bhutto \u2013 Mr Khan also waved a letter at the adoring crowd, alleging it contained evidence of a \u201cforeign conspiracy\u201d in cahoots with \u201ccorrupt thieves\u201d aiming to topple his government.",
    "He has yet to reveal the letter\u2019s contents, despite repeated promises. Adding to the drama, his address to the nation on Wednesday was postponed without explanation.",
    "Imran Khan, elected in July 2018 vowing to tackle corruption and fix the economy, isn\u2019t going quietly.",
    "He hosted a massive rally on Sunday in Islamabad to show he remains wildly popular with his supporters.",
    "Imran Khan\u2019s government does not need to look far to find its troubles. It has lost public support over rocketing inflation and ballooning foreign debt.",
    "\u201cFor instance, from January 2020 to March 2022, India\u2019s food inflation has been about 7% whereas Pakistan\u2019s has been around 23%,\u201d explains Uzair Younus, director of the Pakistan Initiative at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.",
    "But an increasingly fractious relationship with the military \u2013 considered by many the architect of his political success, although both sides deny this \u2013 is why some analysts believe the writing is on the wall for him.",
    "To many observers, the genesis of the current crisis can be traced back to October when Mr Khan refused to sign off on the appointment of a new chief of Pakistan\u2019s powerful ISI intelligence agency.",
    "Analyst Arifa Noor believes that while in Pakistan conflict is \u201cinherent\u201d in the relationship between civilians and the military \u2013 which has directly ruled the country for almost half of its existence \u2013 the issue of replacing intelligence chief General Faiz Hameed caused a rift.",
    "Singapore-based researcher Abdul Basit agrees, adding that the standoff was due to Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cego\u201d and \u201crigidity\u201d which brought an issue into the public domain which was always discussed behind closed doors.",
    "\u201cImran Khan crossed the military\u2019s red line, and while he eventually accepted the appointment of the person the military wanted, it was downhill for him from then on,\u201d he says."
