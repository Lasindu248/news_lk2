    "Former Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mr. S.R. Attygalle says it is unreasonable to claim that the country lost nearly Rs. 500 billion due to the change in tax policies of the new government, as this was due to the loss caused by the import restrictions imposed, including the suspension of the import of vehicles, and the economic contraction caused by the Covid situation.",
