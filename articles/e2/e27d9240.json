  "body_lines": [
    "Fitch Ratings has placed the National Long-Term Ratings of 12 Sri Lankan non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).",
    "The RWN reflects heightened downside risks to the NBFIs\u2019 credit profiles amid increased economic and financial-market volatility in Sri Lanka.",
    "This risk is exacerbated by the deteriorating sovereign credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): C, Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC) and the ensuing risks to the stability of the financial system, the US-based credit rating agency said in its statement.",
    "Fitch says it will review the National Ratings of financial-institution subsidiaries of Sri Lankan corporates that are not included above separately, if needed."
