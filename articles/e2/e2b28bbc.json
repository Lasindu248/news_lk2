    "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today that he had instructed the IGP to report on the progress on the investigation conducted by the police on the attack carried out on the protesters in Galle Face and in front of Temple Trees to the Speaker every other day.",
    "\u201cI have spoken to the IGP and inquired about the progress which the police have made on the investigations and on arrests. I told him to report on the progress to the Speaker every other day,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI have already condemned the attacks on the protesters,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cWe in Parliament should understand the duty which we need to perform today,\u201d he said amidst shouting by the MPs.",
    "\u201cI have not participated in the government parliamentary group and was not aware of the move to nominate MP Ajith Rajapaksa to the post of Deputy Speaker. I also don\u2019t intend to participate in parliamentary group meetings of any political party, he also said.",
    "He said he had nothing to do with electing the deputy Speaker last time when Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was elected to the post and also on the discussions which were held yesterday and day before.",
    "\u201cIt is time all MPs get together to save the nation as the country is facing a grave crisis. I will speak on the crisis in detail in another day, but if Parliament fails to do anything about the crisis at least in a week, I don\u2019t think anyone of us would be able to come to Parliament once again. Therefore I urge the members to come together and appoint the proposed executive council,\u201d he stressed. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
