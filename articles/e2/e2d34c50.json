    "The police have all the right to question those who came on motorbikes because these machines were visibly without number plates. All forms of identity were hidden with the use of tinted sunglass and the riders were masked and attired in full black uniforms.",
    "\u201cThe armed forces of Sri Lanka will always uphold the Constitution and the Army is no exception. The Army, as a professional outfit, is always prepared to provide security and protection to the State as necessary,\u201d\u00a0Gen. Silva",
    "It is the duty of the Army Commander to keep soldiers in the barracks until and unless they are called for in the event of a strict requirement",
    "Last Tuesday\u2019s motorbike circus in the middle of a public protest near the Parliament by members of an alleged military motorbike unit-without number plates- riding fast and ignoring police orders is a show of sheer arrogance and an immature way of acting at a time when the country is on \u2018fire\u2019.",
    "The video of the incident was all over media and social media. It shows the group of black-clad motorcyclists with masked faces behaving irresponsibly, even ignoring police orders\u00a0 for them to stop. The motorbikes with no number plates in the places where they were supposed to be and did not follow the police orders to stop.",
    "It was also evident that the police tried their best to prevent the young protestors moving nearer to the black clad motorbike riders in order to prevent an altercation. In fact, one police officer was heard saying: \u201cApi Bohoma Amaruwen control karagene inne\u201d (we are controlling this situation with the greatest difficulty). He hinted that the so called military men were trying to incite the crowd and create an unnecessary problem.",
    "It was within the rights of the police to arrest the motorcyclists for not obeying police orders and riding without number plates. But this wasn\u2019t done.",
    "It was clearly an action that was done to test the patience of peaceful protestors who were forced to take to the streets not for mere entertainment, but to protest against burning socio-economic problems that have been aggravating day by day.",
    "With never ending queues at petrol stations and absence of fuel that has led to much chaos including the increase in bus and all forms of transportation fares, non-availability of LP gas, 13-hour long power cuts which have disrupted children\u2019s education, and day today work routines of carpenters, electricians, masons, grocery owners, mechanics and many other trades, while supermarket shelves going empty without many essential food items.",
    "There is too, an acute shortage of medicines. The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has claimed an emergency health situation in the country. The problems were not unforeseen. Economists, doctors and many other professionals\u00a0 have been issuing warnings regarding this situation. But these warnings were in vain due to\u00a0 mismanagement.",
    "Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was elected President with 6.9 million votes in a historic victory became a\u00a0 very powerful President. A man who was called a \u2018Hero\u2019 has now dropped to \u2018Zero\u2019; going by what\u2019s written on the many placards displayed at protests all over the country. While there could be many with vested interest among the protestors, no one can deny the genuine reasons that have led people both\u00a0 young and\u00a0 old, from all strata of\u00a0 society including professionals and members of the clergy to take to the streets.",
    "It was the duty of everyone including the police, army and anyone concerned to handle these protests with extreme caution. This is not a time to test the patience of protestors or for that matter anyone else.",
    "For instance if by accident a motorbike rider at the protest site had knocked down a protestor, this story would have had a completely different ending. Provoking the youth at the protests should not have been done by armed men in uniforms in such an unlawful manner.",
    "Former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said in parliament that the conduct of those who came in motorbikes could not be approved.\u00a0 \u201cIt was an idiotic act. These solders have just passed grade 8 and they could have panicked and many things could have happened. There would have been a possibility of someone taking a weapon from these solders by force and firing it,\u201d Fonseka, a battle-hardened\u00a0 \u00a0former officer, added.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t approve of an armed soldier entering a place like that. Whether he came or he was sent is not an issue for me. You can have an inquiry on that,\u201d the former Army Commander stated. He added that if necessary an inquiry on how the police conducted themselves could be done.",
    "Commander of the Army, General Shavendra Silva, addressing a gathering of Defence Advisers/Attaches of Sri Lanka-based High Commissions and embassies, invited to the Office of Chief of Defence Staff\u00a0 on April 4",
    "According to the law it is the Sri Lanka Police that is empowered to act during civil unrest and not the army. Even when the Emergency law is in force, the legitimate power to uphold law and order is in the hands of the police. At an instance when the military is called by the President under Emergency law, it is the duty of the police to act under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 and Public Security Ordinance.",
    "It was reported that the Army Commander and the Defence Secretary have urged the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to conduct an inquiry on the incident. The IGP, who is said to have tendered his apology, is to conduct an inquiry.",
    "As the former Army Commander suggested before the IGP is asked to conduct an inquiry there is also a requirement to inquire into the conduct of the alleged act by the soldiers.",
    "The police have all the right to question those who came on motorbikes because these machines were visibly without number plates. All forms of identity were hidden with the use of tinted sunglass and the riders were masked and attired in full black uniforms. It could have been even a group of terrorists or law breakers who could have impersonated as a section of the motorbike brigade.",
    "It was just last Friday that Chief of Defence Staff and Army Commander General Shavendra Silva, briefed Defence Advisers/Attaches of Sri Lanka-based High Commissions and Embassies assuring that the military would uphold the Constitution of the country.",
    "\u201cThe armed forces of Sri Lanka will always uphold the Constitution and the Army is no exception. The Army, as a professional outfit, is always prepared to provide security and protection to the State as necessary,\u201d Gen. Silva has said. It is the duty of the all ranks and files to walk the talk and act according to the assurance they have given.",
    "It is a known fact that there are already black marks on the country, government and military itself because of the conduct of certain military men. The news about the release of Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake, who was convicted of mass murder, by Gotabaya Rajapaksa even reaches the United Nation Human Rights Commission. As stated by former Army Commander Fonseka, idiotic behaviour by a short sighted few could have reverberating repercussions for the entire country and even the future of those unborn.",
    "It is the duty of the Army Commander to keep soldiers in the barracks until and unless they are called for in the event of a strict requirement.",
    "We must not forget that right now the entire world is keeping an eye on Sri Lanka. A slight mistake on the part of the military or in this case anyone else might lead to putting that too, on the list of allegations against Sri Lanka and updated by the UN Human Rights Council. That list has been growing longer every year."
