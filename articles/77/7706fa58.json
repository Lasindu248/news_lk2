    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) today requested President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to appoint a suitable Cabinet Minister to handle the subject of Power and Energy with immediate effect.",
    "While sending a letter to the President by PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake by order of the commission, he said that there is a serious crisis in the power and energy sectors at present\u00a0 due to the lack of fuel supply to generation plants and drained down hydro reservoirs. Therefore, there is a forced limitation on electricity generation.",
    "The main issue highlighted in the island-wide protests upon the massive unrest surfacing from the general public is the failure of the government to meet the demand for electricity, violating the fundamental rights of the seven million consumers and over 21 million people, the letter said.",
    "As a result, there is an urgent need for an active ministerial portfolio in the power and energy sector, and it is critical that a minister be appointed with the necessary background, knowledge and capability to assist the respective institutions in resolving the present crisis and establishing long-term sustainability in the power and energy sectors.
