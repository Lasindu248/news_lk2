    "PARIS (AP) \u2014 The leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Romania arrived in Kyiv on Thursday in an apparent show of collective European support for Ukraine as it tries to resist Russia\u2019s invasion.",
    "The French president\u2019s office said President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Premier Mario Draghi had traveled to Kyiv together, and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis will join them in the Ukrainian capital.",
    "The European leaders are expected to meet with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-profile Western visit to Kyiv since Russia sent in troops to Ukraine Feb. 24.",
    "The visit comes as EU leaders prepare to make a decision June 23-24 on Ukraine\u2019s request to become a candidate for EU membership, and ahead of an important NATO summit June 29-30 in Madrid.",
    "Also Thursday, NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels to weigh more military aid for Ukraine. On Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced more aid, as America and its allies provide longer-range weapons they say can make a difference in a fight where Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by their Russian invaders.",
    "On Tuesday, during a trip to Ukraine\u2019s neighbors Romania and Moldova, Macron said a \u201cmessage of support\u201d must be sent to Ukraine before EU heads of state and government \u201chave to make important decisions\u201d at their Brussels meeting.",
    "\u201cWe are in a moment where we need to send clear political signals \u2014 we, Europeans, we the European Union \u2014 toward Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,\u201d he said.",
    "Macron is deeply involved in diplomatic efforts to push for a cease-fire in Ukraine that would allow future peace negotiations. He has frequent discussions with Zelenskyy and has spoken on the phone several times with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Putin launched the invasion in late February.",
    "Scholz had long resisted traveling to Kyiv, saying he didn\u2019t want to \u201cjoin the queue of people who do a quick in-out for a photo opportunity.\u201d Instead, Scholz said a trip should focus on doing \u201cconcrete things.\u201d",
    "Germany on Wednesday announced that it will provide Ukraine with three multiple launch rocket systems of the kind that Kyiv has said it urgently needs to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion.",
    "Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany will transfer three M270 medium-range artillery rocket systems along with ammunition to Ukraine.",
    "Germany said the transfer, which echoes similar moves by Britain and the United States, will be accompanied by training and will have \u201ca swift and significant battlefield impact.\u201d"
