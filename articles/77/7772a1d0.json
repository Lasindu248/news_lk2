    "\u201cThe opportunity of world class education from one of many globally ranked Australian universities has assisted Australia to be a top destination for Sri Lankan students looking to study abroad.\u00a0 I am delighted that secondary, vocational and university courses are also being offered in Sri Lanka through 31 partnerships with Australian education providers,\u201d added Holly.",
