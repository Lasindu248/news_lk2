The selection of athletes for this competition was done through a program.\u201d During that program there was a lot of publicity for Sri Lanka. If we did such a promotion by ourselves, it would have cost a lot of money. We also get revenue because they chose Sri Lankan Airlines. It\u2019s a tournament comprising females.
