  "body_lines": [
    "Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said that a system will be introduced, to register all motorists who call over at filling stations in view to manage supply fuel to them.\u00a0 The new system is to be introduced from the first week of July, 2022.",
    "\"We have no choice but to register the motorists at filling stations and give them a guaranteed weekly quota until we would be able to stabilize the financial situation, restore 24-hour Power supply and uninterrupted supply of fuel,\" the minister said.",
    "He said fuel supply management will be impossible until uninterrupted power supply and continual fuel supply are restored.",
    "With the financial restrictions, CPC imports fuel to manage for a week, but some motorists and other individuals collect fuel for a month or even more for their machineries and generators, the minister said.",
    "\"24 hour power supply costs an additional US$ 100 million monthly for Diesel, furnace oil and naphtha. Gas supply shortage has increased the demand for electricity and kerosene. Monthly fuel bill that was US$ 200million four months ago, is at US$ 550million,\" the minister tweeted.(Darshana Sanjeewa Balasuriya)"
