    "National Movement for Social Justice Chairman and former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya says people have understood the devastating effects of the 20th amendment",
    "Warns delay in bringing new amendment will heighten people\u2019s struggle",
    "Says by repealing the 20 A & re-enacting the 19 A, SL would earn the respect and recognition of the international community",
    "Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday called on the Government to incorporate the democratic principles enshrined in the 19th Amendment and pass the 21st Amendment immediately.",
    "Jayasuriya who is also the Chairman of the National Movement for Social Justice said the people have already understood the devastating effects of the 20th amendment and therefore, delaying the new amendment will only lead to a more aggressive and heightened people\u2019s struggle.",
    "\u201cThe damage caused by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution needs no further explanation. It was widely accepted as a selfish and nefarious bill that would lead the country to an undemocratic, dictatorial regime,\u201d the former Speaker said at a press briefing.",
    "He said that by repealing the 20th Amendment and re-enacting the 19th Amendment, Sri Lanka would earn the respect and recognition of the international community as a democratic country in the civilised world thereby allowing us to gain the trust of powerful countries and seek their assistance.",
    "\u201cHowever, given the circumstances, it is unfortunate that one faction of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has quite publicly refused to support these constitutional amendments. This can only be described as a power-hungry political decision,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayasuriya said before the President embarked on the Government\u2019s new reform process, he agreed to ratify the 19th Amendment and abolish the executive presidency while calling on party leaders to work together to form an interim all-party Government.",
    "\u201cWhat the President must understand at this juncture is that if this amendment is delayed due to the undue influence of the ruling party, it will lead to a massive public outcry. People will inevitably be led to believe these were nothing but empty promises and this will only further destroy the image of the President. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and other Ministers who supported the new move will be left humiliated,\u201d Jayasuriya said.",
    "He said it is important for the Government to understand the attitude of the international community towards this issue.\u201d They have always maintained that the 20th Amendment was undemocratic and therefore should be repealed immediately. Meanwhile, religious leaders, civil society, intellectuals and trade unions in our country have repeatedly stated that the 20th Amendment is a bill that leads to a dictatorial path,\u201d he said.",
    "Jayasuriya said that although the Prime Minister clarified that the proposed bill will be presented to the Cabinet next Monday, the General Secretary of the SLPP has stated that the country\u2019s economic issues should be resolved first. \u201cIn other words, he has indirectly stated the party would not support the constitutional amendments. We truly regret that the Secretary-General does not understand the need to win the confidence of the international community to resolve the country\u2019s economic problems,\u201d the former Speaker said.",
    "He added that the Bar Association of Sri Lanka has also pointed out the shortcomings of the proposed bill and that the National Movement for Social Justice too has presented a few observations."
