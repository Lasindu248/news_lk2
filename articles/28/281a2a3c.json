    "As this is being written hundreds of thousands of ordinary people, in defiance of a sudden curfew ordered\u00a0 by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa,\u00a0 are roaming the streets of\u00a0 towns and cities all over Sri Lanka, demanding the ouster of the man himself. They have been supported, in a unique display of solidarity\u00a0 by the \u201cSri Lankan\u201d diaspora, in cities in\u00a0 US, UK, across Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\u00a0 The Rajapaksa name, once revered by the Snhala-Buddhist majority, is now being publicly reviled across continents. The Rajapaksa\u2019s very successfully weaponized ethnic disharmony and\u00a0 ethno-nationalism\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to secure political power. But the purple \u201cKurakkan Satakaya\u201d, that ostentatious Rajapaksa family brand,\u00a0 has\u00a0 strangled the nation. Within two years of the new Rajapaksa dispensation, its appalling mis-governance has compelled a divided people to unite against a common enemy, the First Family. It seems incomprehensible that the\u00a0 family, diabolically clever at leveraging public sentiment, could have been so insensitive to the seething\u00a0 discontent within\u00a0 the same polity.",
    "The \u201cTerminator\u201d has\u00a0\u00a0 lost his invincibility, his ability to inspire dread,\u00a0 and stands pathetically exposed for the man he has always been; an average military man of\u00a0\u00a0 limited intellect, ignorant in the ways of\u00a0 governance, macro-economics, both\u00a0 internal and external\u00a0 political realities,\u00a0 completely out of touch with the pulse of an agitated\u00a0 nation\u00a0 and the suffering\u00a0 of the people who elected him, and incapable of solving\u00a0 problems which do not respond to para-military reprisals.\u00a0 Recall his recent response to the farmers\u2019 opposition to organic fertilizer, that he could, if he wished, use the army to compel the farmers to comply with his diktat!",
    "This is the man that Dr.Dayan Jayatilleke, political analyst and, during the Yahapalanaya regime,\u00a0 an\u00a0 ardent proponent of a Rajapaksea revival (remember his ecstatic\u00a0 \u201cNugegoda Rising\u201d- Colombo Telegraph, 19/02/2015-\u00a0 and DJ himself reading out the absent Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s message) described, in a writing of around March 2017, \u201c as a man who could lead the country towards a fair and just society in which ethnic and religious factors can be transcended in a new fusion\u2026\u2026..a decorated warrior who knows how to defend his country at the risk of his life\u2026\u2026a man with a modernizing vision and capacity\u2026..fighter and builder\u2026..any country needs and should be proud to have\u201d.\u00a0 He has\u00a0 been proved wrong on all counts but, if an intellectual like Dr. DJ could have been\u00a0\u00a0 so misled, one should not fault the 6.9 mn ordinary citizens for having embraced\u00a0 the same misconceptions.",
    "Interestingly, Dr. DJ now writes (Island-03/04/22- Roundtables as Political Change Agents) \u201c Always remember the objective; removing the incumbent autocrat and the regime, centered round the ruling clan; the target is not the rival party nor its proponents. The target is the democratic removal of the ruler and his parasitic and paralysis inducing clan\u201d; a complete\u00a0 volte-face, gradual and long in coming but, nonetheless,\u00a0 refreshing.",
    "This is also the man that the\u00a0 leading members of the Sangha lionized\u00a0 as a \u201cHitler \u201c who could transform the fortunes of the country whilst ushering in a new\u00a0 order.\u00a0 Unsaid but implied was that it would also be an essentially Sinhala-Buddhist hegemony, the\u00a0 Rajapakse\u00a0 concept which also\u00a0 resonates with the majority of our polity.",
    "The\u00a0 Sangha, schooled\u00a0 in the Dhamma but possibly ignorant of History,\u00a0 were perhaps\u00a0 unaware that the real Hitler\u00a0 died by his own hand,\u00a0 even as his enemies closed in upon his last refuge.\u00a0 Historically, almost inevitably, autocratic, tyrannical\u00a0 leaders,\u00a0 have come to brutal or ignominious ends.\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from Hitler, recall Mussolini, Franco, both\u00a0 Duvaliers, father and son, Pinochet, Shah Reza Pahlavi, Marcos, Ceausescu, Idi Amin, Gaddafi and Saddam, as just a few examples. The\u00a0 president urgently needs to engage in a capsule history lesson of the last seven decades. Perhaps someone should educate him\u00a0 about Hosni Mubarak and the \u201c Arab Spring\u201d.",
    "The protests were first launched by desperate farmers, in response\u00a0 to the moronic presidential directive to convert to organic farming overnight.\u00a0\u00a0 With the fuel crisis, power outages, disruptions to public transport, dismantling of livelihoods, shortages of staples\u00a0 and\u00a0 the unbearable increase in the cost of living, demonstrations\u00a0 spread to all parts of the country, engaging\u00a0 citizens of all social and economic levels. However, the agitation was\u00a0 allowed to continue.",
    "The Mirihana\u00a0 affair changed all that.\u00a0\u00a0 The origins of the shift of an angry, yet non-violent\u00a0 protest,\u00a0 to actual violence is unclear. However,\u00a0 whilst\u00a0 damaged vehicles were still smoldering and\u00a0 clearly before even an investigation had commenced, the president\u2019s media division announced that responsibility lay with an organized \u201cextremist group\u201d, giving credence\u00a0 to the now popular view that the violence was orchestrated in order to justify\u00a0\u00a0 the repressive measures which followed.",
    "So, no sooner the sacrosanct personal abode of the ruler was besieged, the Public Security Act was invoked, an emergency declared,\u00a0 a curfew\u00a0 imposed and social media shut down;\u00a0 a response typical of all autocrats, who are deeply sensitive to any assault on their personal authority and, in times of strife, apprehensive of any sign of personal danger; hardly a\u00a0 response worthy of a \u201cdecorated\u00a0 warrior\u201d or a \u201cfighter\u201d.",
    "\u201c Gota Go Home\u201d is the\u00a0 a demand resonating across Sri Lanka and in other countries as well, articulated in Sinhala, English and Tamil. However, the solution to the problems that the man\u2019s irrational decisions have exacerbated is not that simple. The current economic woes of the country are the cumulative result of irresponsible fiscal\u00a0 management across successive regimes. For decades we have been living beyond our means. The earlier Rajapksa regime compounded the problem,\u00a0 engaging in\u00a0 massive infrastructure projects with minimal prospects of even long-term returns, and\u00a0 nominal\u00a0\u00a0 trickle-down benefits to ordinary people.",
    "President GR, immediately after assuming office, provided sweeping and unwarranted tax concessions to a small segment, depriving the state of revenue. The Covid pandemic contributed further to the decline in the GDP; the organic fertilizer decree brought agriculture to its knees; the nation\u2019s finances\u00a0 were\u00a0 entrusted to brother Basil, touted as a genius despite clear evidence of lack of basic intellect.\u00a0\u00a0 Assisting him was Nivard Cabraal, originally a common or garden accountant from a modest city hotel,\u00a0 labouring under the delusion that he is an economist,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 who famously declared that excessive printing of money does not cause inflation! His criminal mismanagement of the rupee/dollar relationship\u00a0 has been, time and again, cruelly exposed\u00a0 by genuine economists, whilst his refusal to engage meaningfully with the IMF, when crucial,\u00a0\u00a0 denied the country of a possible life-line until it was too late; the controversial bond repayment of USD 500 million in January, emptying foreign reserves,\u00a0 was the last nail in the coffin. The fallout from the Ukraine-Russia conflict did the rest; that is a fatal\u00a0 combination of ungovernable externalities and internal idiocies.",
    "As much as an incompetent and obdurate president, the servile cabinet and parliament\u00a0 are also to blame. The government group, a collective rubber stamp, having first empowered the president with the safe passage of the 20th amendment,\u00a0\u00a0 ignoring financial discipline and the enactment of law,\u00a0 legitimized every whim and fancy of the ruler.\u00a0 In parliament today,\u00a0 the same lackeys, now mock-repentant,\u00a0 sanctimoniously called for reforms to provide a solution to the problems\u00a0 that they themselves created.",
    "The pundits of the \u201cViyath Maga\u201d and the luminaries of the \u201cEliya Maga\u201d,\u00a0 many of them\u00a0 leading entrepreneurs, professionals and co-called intellectuals,\u00a0 who enthusiastically endorsed\u00a0 the president\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 delusional \u201cVistas of Prosperity\u201d must also accept their share of responsibility. Perhaps the president\u2019s personal soothsayer, \u201cGnana Akka\u201d, should also shoulder the blame, for having negotiated divine approval for his irrational strategies!!",
    "What is the solution to the crisis?\u00a0 The president\u2019s invitation to the opposition, to join\u00a0 an interim administration and to assist in the rehabilitation of the economy has been rejected. The cabinet and ministers have resigned (??)\u00a0 and the president has reappointed a few, assigning them different portfolios. However,\u00a0 National List appointee Ali Sabry, in a demonstration of morality absent when he accepted the Ministry of Justice\u00a0 despite being the president\u2019s personal lawyer, has resigned from\u00a0 the Finance portfolio within 24 hours.",
    "The same empty heads on different bodies,\u00a0 still in servitude to an\u00a0 all powerful president,\u00a0 will not\u00a0 usher in essential change,\u00a0 which must be implemented through an empowered parliament, possible only if the 20th amendment is repealed and the 19th amendment further strengthened; a complicated and\u00a0 time-consuming process but that which\u00a0 will enable independent commissions, oversight committees and councils, now either inactive or incapacitated, to function effectively and restore accountability and\u00a0 public scrutiny to executive action. The president, despite the\u00a0 havoc he has significantly contributed to, still misses\u00a0 the point and\u00a0 must be compelled by some means to relinquish the untrammeled power assigned to him by the 20th amendment.",
    "Of course, the simplest would be for the president to heed the nation\u2019s call and resign, as provided by the Constitution, paving the way for a complete political restructuring. A new cabinet with the old faces with GR as\u00a0 president, wielding\u00a0 the same power,\u00a0 will\u00a0\u00a0 be a complete farce and is quite likely to\u00a0 lead to renewed citizens\u2019 agitation. It is clear that the Rajapaksa family and its minions are now anathema. The failure to devise realistic strategies for the immediate, mid-term and long-term solutions for the current problems, and to convey them effectively and convincingly to a maddened\u00a0 public, could result in the ongoing protests catalyzing in to total anarchy.",
    "Apart from funding internal fuel and\u00a0 medicine needs, import of basic foodstuffs, raw materials for industries and meeting\u00a0 bi-lateral and multi-lateral loan repayments,\u00a0 the country\u00a0 must\u00a0 meet a USD one billion international sovereign bond repayment in full by July 2022. If we fail\u00a0 to meet these commitments or\u00a0 to restructure\u00a0 debt repayment, the country will enter a state of \u201cdisorderly default\u201d, a situation in which we will be shunned by all international aid and donor agencies and governments.\u00a0 Sri Lanka will become a pariah state.\u00a0 Bear in mind the once prosperous Lebanon,\u00a0 now the global archetype of total failure.",
    "A few days\u00a0 ago, social media activist Anuruddha Bandara was allegedly abducted by a group claiming to be from the police, and was later found at the Modera police station. His crime- posting a message on social media, with the slogan, \u201cGo Home, Gota\u201d, the same\u00a0 cry\u00a0 resonating across the country and continents in recent days. Had not the legal fraternity come to his aid\u00a0 in an incredible show of force,\u00a0 Bandara could have disappeared, like so\u00a0 many dissenters did in similar circumstances in the past. His quick\u00a0 retrieval and the subsequent operation of due processes, is evidence that black operations of suppression of dissent, so brutally efficient\u00a0 when the present president was secretary of defence, are no longer as effective. That in itself is an encouraging sign.",
