    "M.M.C. Ferdinando said he only realized that he mistakenly made such a comment when the Minister inquired from him about the matter on Saturday (11) morning.",
    "Speaking on the letter sent to the Treasury Secretary, the CEB Chairman said he directed it as it was a matter related to the Board of Investment.",
    "However, the Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman told the Parliamentary Watchdog on Friday (10) that he was told by the President that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was insisting that the energy investments projects be awarded to the Adani Group.",
    "Appearing at the Committee on Public Enterprises hearing in Parliament on Friday (10), the CEB Chairman said that following a meeting chaired by the President, he was summoned by the Head of State and was told that the Indian Prime Minister was insisting that the 500 MW wind power plant be given to India\u2019s Adani Group.",
    "\u201cI told him (President) that this is not a matter related to me or the CEB and it should be referred to the Board of Investment,\u201d he told COPE.",

    "\u201cStatement made by the #lka CEB Chairman at a COPE committee hearing regarding the award of a Wind Power Project in Mannar, I categorically deny authorization to award this project to any specific person or entity.

    "As proposed by the Adani company, if a transmission system is set-up to supply electricity from Sri Lanka to India, what would happen if India controls Sri Lanka\u2019s power supply?",
    "In Parliament, Sri Lanka\u2019s Opposition charged that an unsolicited government-to-government agreement to build a 500 MW wind power plant in the northern coast with the involvement of the Adani Group was the main reason to bring forward amendments to the 1989 Act.",
