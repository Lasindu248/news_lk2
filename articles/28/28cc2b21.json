    "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce commends the Governor and his team at Central Bank of Sri Lanka for permitting greater flexibility in the exchange rate. This action has been proposed by the Ceylon Chamber, on its own and along with other chambers on numerous occasions in the recent past.",
    "Hence, the Chamber is pleased to note this announcement by CBSL and believes that it will contribute significantly to ease the shortage of dollars currently experienced.",
