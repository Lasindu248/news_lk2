  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); It is necessary for the police to immediately investigate the incidents of violence which occurred in the country\u00a0since 9th of May which have gravely impacted on the life of the community and to deal with the\u00a0perpetrators according to law, states the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.",
    "Accordingly, it is the view of the BASL that these acts should be expeditiously investigated,\u00a0and the perpetrators of the violence identified and arrested forthwith.",
    "Pointing out that in many instances, the BASL has been\u00a0informed that evidence of perpetrators and those aiding and abetting them are available on social media as\u00a0well as CCTV footage, the association urged for immediate and impartial investigations into these incidents, which would help to restore public order and create\u00a0confidence in the law enforcement authorities and establish Rule of Law in the country."
