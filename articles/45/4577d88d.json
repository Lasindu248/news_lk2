    "\u201cAs a result of the depth of the crisis we are facing there is no alternative but to establish a currency board.\u201d",
    "Under a currency board no money can be printed for open market operations and all interventions are unsterilized and short term rates fluctuate freely.",
    "However there were several challenges to setting up a currency board at this time which has to be overcome, Wijewardene said.",
    "One was that new capital was needed to match the domestic monetary base (MO) as the credibility of a currency board comes from being fully backed by foreign reserves.",

    "A currency board will prevent governments from destroying the value of money which the ordinary people earn though hard work, Wijewardena said.",
    "Wijewardena\u2019s comments came as US economist Steve Hanke tweeted that Sri Lanka should establish a currency board to end 72 years of monetary instability from the flexible exchange rate of soft-peg.",
    "Sri Lanka should set up a currency board to stop rupee depreciation: US economist",
    "It is not clear where the rupee will eventually stop with surrender requirements and low interest rates hampering a clean float.",
    "Usually a currency board is set up in a crisis country under Hanke\u2019s formula after a free float is established for several weeks and the effects of previous money printing is fully dissipated in the banking system.",
    "Most Sri Lankans alive first learned about currency boards from Wijewardena.",
    "Wijewardene had for many years showed the virtues of a currency board, pointing out how Singapore\u2019s economic architect Goh Keng Swee maintained the \u2018Colonial\u2019 currency board as its foundation to build a free trading low inflation economy without social unrest.",
    "Goh said the country did not believe in Keynesianism which became fashionable after the US Fed triggered the Great Depression but believed in hard work.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s monetary policy had deteriorated rapidly after Wijewardene retired as Deputy Governor of the Central Bank shortly after the country went through a massive civil war in 2009 amidst the collapse of the Greenspan-Bernanke bubble.",
    "Observers say a country cannot depend on the personality and knowledge of one person to maintain currency and rogue policy and un-anchored or dual anchor monetary policy (flexible exchange rate) must be constrained by law.",

    "But knowledge about currency board was lost and unusual beliefs about currency boards were propagated at key UK universities (except LSE) and so-called \u2018saltwater universities of the US, where Keynesianism was adopted as a \u2018new religion\u2019 as the saying went.",
    "Wijewardene had dubbed the unusually volumes of money printed in the last two years the \u2018Lakshman\u2019 shock.",
    "A key reason for abolishing the currency board was to give \u2018monetary policy independence\u2019 to central bankers to practice rogue policy.",
    "A key reason for setting up a currency board is that the general public and legislators no longer believe economists who want to engage in open market operations and competitive exchange rate to give profits to businesses at the expense of workers.",
    "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority which operates on currency board principles raised policy rates by 25 basis points on March 17 after the US Federal Reserve raised its own rates.",
    "The UAE Monetary Authority which operates the Dirham on the principles very similar to a currency board (currency board like as dubbed by Hanke), also raised rates.",
    "Interest rates in countries with currency board are very low and barely above that of the anchor currency which can be the US dollar or any larger country with a very good central bank. The US dollar is generally chosen because it is a large importer of goods and has open capital markets.",

    "Currencies that collapse steeply lead to spontaneous dollarization as people adopt foreign currencies to make transactions and demand dollar salaries from their employers.",
    "A central bank usually imposes legal tender laws to prevent the use of alternative currencies and force people to use their bad depreciating money.",
