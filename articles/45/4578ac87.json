    "With the assurance of supplying adequate diesel to power plants by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), there will be no need to extend the daily power shedding up to ten hours, instead, it would reduce gradually, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said.",
    "PUCSL Chairman Janaka Rathnayaka said the CEB has guaranteed to supply the daily requirement of 3,500 MT of diesel for the next two weeks, which is sufficient to run the thermal power plants.",
    "Therefore, consumers can be assured that the power shedding prevalent at the moment would drastically come down, he said.",
    "He said if we had managed the hydro power generation properly, we would be able to manage the situation while reducing the power cuts to a manageable level, such as two or three hours per day.",
    "\"We have 10,000 MT of fuel in stock, and another shipment of 20,000 MT being unloaded today. A shipment of 30,000 MT of fuel is scheduled to reach by Monday.",
