    "Hydro power generation will be further disrupted due to the low water level in the reservoirs associated with the Ceylon Electricity Board hydro power plants, the Energy Ministry said.",
    "They said the water level present in the reservoirs used to generate electricity is rapidly declining due to the severe dry weather conditions that have affected the entire country.",
    "The number of units of electricity that can be generated from the remaining volume of water at Castlereigh, Maussakelle, Samanalawewa, Kotmale and Victoria reservoirs is 7.3, 77.7, 15.2, 29.0 and 133.3 gigawatt hours.",
    "Releasing water from these reservoirs to Mahaweli will also be restricted, as the country's drinking water requirements and agricultural activities should be given priority.",
    "Therefore, the ministry repeatedly requests the public to use electricity cautiously. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
