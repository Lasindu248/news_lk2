    "While saying that the sluice gates of Randenigala and Rantambe reservoirs have been opened by some unscrupulous elements, even those reservoirs were not functioning to generate hydropower at present, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara requested Speaker to take steps to beef up security to the reservoirs.",
    "He told Parliament that some trade unions were engaged in strike, cannot be allowed to resort to such acts of sabotage.",
    "He said if spill gates of reservoirs were opened at the time when those reservoirs don't function to generate hydropower, is an act of sabotage. The end result is, for power generation, the country has to totally rely on diesel and other sources."
