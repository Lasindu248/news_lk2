    "COLOMBO (News 1st); All of us have failed our duty, and we have failed to address ourselves with public sentiment, says Ceylon Workers Congress MP Jeevan Thondaman.",
    "Speaking at Parliament today (07), the MP pointed out that while people are holding placard all over the country because they do not have a voice in Parliament, those with a voice are holding placards inside the Parliament, which is a very senseless thing to do.",
    "He further stated that the MPs are not speaking on issues they should be speaking about, and are simply delaying the inevitable.",
    "\u201cAnd that inevitable means people\u2019s lives at stake, the economy at stake. Even now we are still playing the blame game, and it is exactly why people are out on the streets. You must understand the sentiments of the people. When they say Go Home Gota, they don\u2019t mean just the President. They don\u2019t mean just the Rajapaksas. They mean all the members of Parliament sitting here right now. All of us have failed in our duty,\u201d he added."
