  "body_lines": [
    "The government has launched a cold hunt on leaders of the struggle, activists and people who demand basic rights instead of trying to meet basic needs of the people, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said today.",
    "He told a news conference that the government was attempting to arrest and intimidate leaders of the struggle and activists on court orders by filing false allegations.",
    "He said the government should stop these moves immediately or else they would have to face serious protest campaigns.",
    "\"A Court order has been obtained to arrest 9 individuals including the convenor of the Socialist Youth Union (SYU), Jagath Manuwarna and two monks. This is a serious matter. The right to protest is ensured by the Constitution,\" he said.",
    "Mr. Silva said the government is plotting to arrest those in the struggle so as to cover up the real culprits.",
    "\"It is not those who were issued with court orders are the real culprits. They are the ones who were in the struggle to win people's rights. The real culprits who ruined the economy and destroyed people's lives are in the government,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
