  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The\u00a0Bar Association of Sri Lanka states that it is\u00a0of the view that a declaration of a state of emergency is not the answer to the present\u00a0situation in the country, and had called upon the President to revoke the Emergency proclamation.",
    "In a statement, the BASL states that unfortunately, those in authority have until very recently failed to understand the gravity of the\u00a0situation and the grave impact the crisis has on the life of the people and the community. The\u00a0unprecedented power cuts extending for over half the day, the fuel shortages, gas shortages, drugs\u00a0shortages, the foreign exchange crisis and the escalating prices of essential items have all resulted in\u00a0the people of this country being driven to desperation.",
    "It adds that the state of\u00a0emergency must not be used to stifle peaceful protests and dissent or to make arbitrary arrests and\u00a0detentions.",
