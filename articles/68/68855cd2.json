    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The President\u2019s next actions will be significant as it is up to him to take a honorable political turn, says\u00a0Anuruddha Somatunga, the Convener of the\u00a0National Movement for the Protection of Public Rights.",
    "Speaking to media, Somatunga pointed out that even after people empowered the President by electing him, this is not the manner which the President should treat those who elected him into power.",
    "Therefore, he stated that the current challenge is elevating this pressure and taking the struggle to the streets. The people of this country are taking to the streets to show their civil power in a non-political manner, without any distinctions as to caste, race, or religion demanding the President to leave, which is a very important social feature, Somatunga stated.",
    "As all groups of people have said no, it is the Government\u2019s responsibility to respect their wishes, he mentioned. If the people asks anyone to leave, it is important to respect that decision and make a honorable political turn.",
