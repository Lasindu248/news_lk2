    "Senior sources said that while Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has refused to resign saying he had the majority support in Parliament, the President however has been privately been urging him to resign. However the Prime Minister has clearly informed the President that he would not vacate his seat at a time when he was trying to resolve the economic crisis, but if the President wanted to sack him, he could do so.",
