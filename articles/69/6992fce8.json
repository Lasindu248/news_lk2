    "Whilst reiterating the said denial and without prejudice to same, by way of clarification, the management states that upon being approached by the police to make a statement as to whether any inconvenience was caused to the hotel by the ongoing protests, one of the managers had specifically stated that inconvenience was only caused due to the road closures effected by the authorities on 29.04.2022 by installing barricades obstructing the road leading to the hotel.",
