    "Electricity and petroleum regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has expressed its concern over the state of emergency declared on last Friday (6), insisting that the measure will further aggravate the economic crisis, as it does not provide solutions for public outcry.",
    "In a letter addressed to the Secretary to the President Gamini Senerath on the state of emergency which was declared for the second time in five weeks, the PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake pointed out that he believes scheduled power cuts was the main reason and cause which led public upheaval.",
    "\u201cThe PUCSL requests the Government to revoke public emergency, as it will further destabilise the present economic situation bringing more hardships to the common people, where the Commission will not be able to exercise its mandate in serving and looking after the interests/needs of specially consumers and other stakeholders,\u201d he added.",
    "PUCSL pointed out that the prime obligation and duty of the Commission is to ensure that the interests of over 7.3 million direct electricity users and indirect beneficiaries of over 21 million from new-born to bed-ridden users and of those utility industries are protected and looked after."
