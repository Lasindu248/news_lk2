    "The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Sri Lanka (MMCA Sri Lanka) has extended Rotation 1 of its current exhibition \u2018Encounters\u2019 until 22 May 2022. The three artworks that provide the starting points for Rotation 1 include one painting by Senaka Senanayake (b. 1951) and two paintings by George Keyt (1901\u20131993) titled \u2018The Friends\u2019 (1982) and \u2018Pounding Paddy\u2019 (1952). The two paintings by Keyt provide the starting points for two displays that explore stories and ideas about love, intimacy, friendship, and family. The museum has extended this rotation by over a month to allow audiences more opportunities to visit the exhibition and look at artworks by Pradeep Thalawatta (b. 1979) in relation to Keyt\u2019s \u2018The Friends\u2019 and further artworks by Asai Rasiah (1946\u20132020), Richard Gabriel (1924\u20132016) and Susiman Nirmalavasan (b. 1982) in relation to Keyt\u2019s \u2018Pounding Paddy\u2019.",
