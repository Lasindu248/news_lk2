    "The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has informed the Narahenpita fuel station, which was allocated for the MPs to fill their fuel, that if any MP wants to fill their vehicle tanks, they must come in the queue and no special preference should be given to them.",
    "CPC Trade Union officials told Daily Mirror that following a tense situation at the Narahenipta Filling Station today, the Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara had informed them to stop giving special preference to VIPs or MPs.",
    "Desperate consumers who were in the queue for hours overnight had threatened the filling station employees to stop the preferential treatment immediately.",
    "As a result, the Trade Unions said that instructions had been given to the shed employees that if any MPs require fuel, they must wait in the queue like all citizens.",
    "The CPC Trade Unions further denied reports that fuel was sold at subsidized rates to the MPs saying this was a false claim as fuel was sold to all at the market rates.",
    "Social media pictures circulating that fuel was sold for MPs at Rs.121 a litre may have been filmed when there was a system upgrade and this was not the price the fuel was sold at, the CPC Trade Unions said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrema)"
