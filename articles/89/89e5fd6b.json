    "While rejecting the move by the president to appoint a new cabinet, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) yesterday called for an immediate repealing of the 20th Amendment to the constitution and for the appointment of a committee of party leaders to scrap the Executive Presidency.",
    "SJB National Organizer Tissa Attanayake told a press conference that these two measures should be implemented within this week.",
    "\u201cWe want the repealing of 20th Amendment and the appointment of a committee on party leaders done within this week. Immediate implementation of such steps will send a positive signal to the world that Parliament is working towards resolving the present political crisis. This will also indicate that the government had made a positive approach towards resolving the present crisis,\u201d Attanayake said.",
    "\u201cA mere change of cabinet ministers will not serve any purpose. It is like changing your pillow as a remedy for the headache. Cabinet reshuffle is not what the people want. What they want is the resignation of President, Prime Minister and formation of a new government with those who are capable of turning the economy around,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile Attanayake questioned the decision made by national carrier SriLankan Airlines to lease 21 new aircraft. \u201cThe authorities said the decision to lease out 21 aircraft was made before the Covid hit the country. However the authorities should have taken into consideration the financial position of the entity. The airline had eaten up a total of Rs 370 billion after it was taken back from Emirates,\u201d the MP alleged.",
    "In another development, Attanayake said SJB has faith in some members in the Central Bank Monitory Board. (Yohan Perera)"
