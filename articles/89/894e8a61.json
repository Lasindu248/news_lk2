    "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says that hydropower generation has been increased to 31% due to rising water levels in reservoirs associated with power plants.",
    "The CEB also said that the water levels in the reservoirs associated with the power plants are rapidly rising due to heavy rains in catchment areas.",
    "Hydropower generation had dropped to as low as 7% as water levels had dropped dramatically in recent days. However, the Ceylon Electricity Board says it expects to increase hydropower generation to around 50% in the future.",
    "The Department of Irrigation said the water level in the main reservoirs has risen to 66% due to the heavy rains that are falling in many parts of the country."
