    "SLPP MP Basil Rajapaksa has decided to step down from his parliamentary seat by tomorrow, sources said.",
    "Rajapaksa had informed his party members that he would continue to be active in party politics but would not hold his parliamentary seat. He will announce his resignation at a media briefing tomorrow morning.",
    "Rajapaksa was anyway expected to step down as MP as the 21st amendment is ready to be put to parliament. The amendment includes the clause that dual citizens will not be able to hold parliamentary seats or contest future elections.",
    "Sources said the man tipped to take over Rajapaksa's seat is either business tycoon Dhammika Perera or Colombo district SLPP Organizer Renuka Perera.\u00a0(JAMILA HUSAIN)"
