  "body_lines": [
    "Claims industry unable to continue production due to unavailability of animal feed",
    "Says essentials for animal feed have not been imported during past 4 months",
    "Opines industry requires at least Rs. 30 m monthly to ensure continuity of production lines",
    "The All Ceylon Poultry Traders Association (ACPTA) yesterday clarified reasons for the increased prices of eggs, whilst noting that at least Rs. 30 million must be made available monthly to ensure continuity of production lines.",
    "\u201cThe price hike in eggs is not done voluntarily. It is due to the high cost of production that the farmers are experiencing. The industry is finding it extremely challenging to import animal feed required for the production lines at present,\u201d ACPTA President Ajith H. Gunasekara said.",
    "Eggs are considered a low-cost source of protein food that is suitable for a healthy meal. However, at present the price of an average-size egg in the market is over Rs. 40 and consumers are lamenting on the ever-increasing cost.",
    "The egg producers claim under the current circumstances, they are unable to continue production activities, as they are unable to source local ingredients for animal feed, especially corn.",
    "Gunasekera pointed out that other essentials for animal feed have not been imported for more than four months given the high prices, adding that eggs require 73% of animal feed.",
    "He also said that discussions were held with the Government in March and requests were made to make dollars available for the necessary imports to purchase raw materials.",
    "As per him, at least Rs. 30 million should be made available monthly for importers to ensure production lines continue."
