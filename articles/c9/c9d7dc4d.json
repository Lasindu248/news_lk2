    "Charles Leclerc won a blockbuster 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix as Carlos Sainz backed up a Ferrari one-two \u2013 as Red Bull suffered a double DNF to give Lewis Hamilton the final podium place in a stunning start to the season.",
    "Verstappen, starting P2, attempted to undercut Ferrari\u2019s pole-sitter Leclerc on Lap 15, cutting down what was a 3.5s deficit to just 0.35s when Leclerc emerged in the lead on Lap 16. That triggered a three-lap box-office bout for the lead, Leclerc hanging on when Verstappen locked up into Turn 1 on Lap 19.",
    "The second round of pit stops, again catalysed by Verstappen, took place on Lap 31 but this time Leclerc had a far more comfortable lead. Everything was straightforward until Verstappen pitted on Lap 44.",
    "Two laps later, Pierre Gasly brought out the Safety Car when his AlphaTauri stopped in flames, and Leclerc took the opportunity to pit too. The Lap 51 restart saw Leclerc scamper off into the distance while Verstappen \u2013 nursing a steering issue and upset by what he suspected was a power unit glitch \u2013 just couldn\u2019t keep up.",
    "Sainz capitalised on Verstappen\u2019s woes and took P2 off the champion on Lap 54, Perez and Hamilton following suit. Having challenged for the lead earlier on, it ended up being a terrible day for the world champion, who ended up retiring at the end of that tour.",
    "Hamilton was right on Perez\u2019s tail \u2013 and then the Mexican began to complain of a power unit issue, and it turned from bad to worse for the reigning drivers\u2019 championship-winning team when Perez spun at Turn 1 when his engine gave way on the final lap, giving Hamilton the final podium place.",
    "Russell, who started ninth, enjoyed superior race pace to the midfielders and took P4 after the Red Bulls retired, ahead of Kevin Magnussen \u2013 fifth for Haas on his return to F1.",
    "Valtteri Bottas rescued P6 after a poor start for Alfa Romeo, while Esteban Ocon shrugged off a penalty early on for contact with Mick Schumacher to take a surprise seventh.",
    "In P8 was AlphaTauri\u2019s Yuki Tsunoda, solid on his final stint and in the final restart, while Fernando Alonso shrugged off poor pace in his second stint to take ninth.",
    "And on debut, Zhou Guanyu took points for Alfa Romeo \u2013 Mick Schumacher missing out in P11.",
