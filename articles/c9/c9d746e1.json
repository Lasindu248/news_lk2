    "Commenting on the results, Chairman of People\u2019s Bank, Sujeewa Rajapakse said: \u201cTimes are extraordinary with the macro stresses clearly unprecedented. The Bank\u2019s results however provide insight into its financial strength and capacity to navigate through these challenging circumstances. Needless to say, like for most other, the lack of foreign currency reserves in the country \u2013 is the Institution\u2019s key source of distress. As a Domestically Systematically Important Bank with a broader national role \u2013 the Institution played a leading role post COVID 19 to support the Government and the country\u2019s internal eco system function without any interruption by supporting, amongst many other, bulk of the country\u2019s essential imports such as petroleum, pharmaceutical, coal and fertilizer. To ease pressure from the Bank\u2019s standpoint, several measures are currently being explored in coordination and support of its key stakeholders\u201d",

From both a business and operational standpoint, we have intensified our focus on few key areas. On a business front, considering the volatile interest rate environment and the inevitable pressure on net interest margins as now seen, we have increased our focus on non-interest-based income sources and, considering the country\u2019s foreign currency shortfall, we are in the process of expanding our foreign inward remittances platform and footprint. In addition, as a crucial element to the country\u2019s economic revival \u2013 we have allocated greater resources to support Small and Medium Scale Enterprises and certain other economy critical market segments.",
