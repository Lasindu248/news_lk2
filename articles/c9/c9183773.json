    "The following mail came my way, last Tuesday, and I thought of giving it the necessary publicity.",
    "I\u2019m a regular reader of your music page and I need to thank you for keeping us updated with the latest happenings in the music scene.",
    "What intrigued me, reading your page on Tuesday (April 26th), was your column Seen \u2018N\u2019 Heard, and this is what you had mentioned\u2026",
    "Is this the correct time to have \u2018Rock Star\u2019 auditions for kids (yes, for kids), between 4-6 years, when the country is in turmoil?",
    "Even if the scene here was normal, many say it\u2019s not the right thing to do to get 4-6 year-old kids involved in such events.",
    "I\u2019m a parent of two kids, five years, and eight years, and I would not, under any circumstances, send them, at this point in time, to participate in any musical event.",
    "And, I can\u2019t fathom, who, in his/her right mind, would put together such an event\u2026for kids, aged four to six years.",
    "As you quite rightly said, even if there was normalcy in the country, it\u2019s preposterous to get little kids involved in such events.",
    "Under no circumstances should one allow little minds to be focused on ROCK MUSIC.",
