    "All paediatricians and neonatologists in the country are in dilemma due to the absence of Endotracheal (ETT) Tubes for the ventilation of new-born babies, infants and children, Castle Street Teaching Hospital Consultant Neonatologist Dr. L.P.C. Saman Kumara said.",
    "He said it will be very soon all hospitals will run out of all their stocks of ETTs, and the hospitals have come to the situation where they are re-using the endotracheal tubes for ventilating new born babies, which is totally unacceptable.",
    "Due to the economic and political crisis in the country, medical supplies have run out in the hospital network, the doctor said.",
    "Therefore, the hospital doctors are forced to change their norms of using re-usable ventilator circuits in the country.",
    "\"With the current perilous\u00a0 situation in the country, Dr. Kumara sends an appeal to the people living overseas to find a way to send some Neonatal ETTs which are in 4mm, 3.5mm, 3mm, 2.5mm, and 2mm in sizes. But we mostly need size 3 mm and 3.5 mm, \"he said.",
    "We need a national requirement of 3,500 Neonatal ETTs in sizes 3 mm and 3.5 mm, as well as 500 in size 4 mm, on an annual basis. 2,500 from 2.5mm and 500 from 2mm, the doctor added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
