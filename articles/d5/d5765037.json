    "Europe Day, held on 9 May every year, is a celebration of peace and unity. This year, it had a special significance. With war at the doorstep of Europe and with a deep economic crisis in Sri Lanka, peace and prosperity are at stake. In that context, we invited children from Sri Lanka and the Maldives to express themselves and show us how they see peace through art.\u201d EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Denis Chaibi, said recently.He said so as the Delegation of the European Union (EU) to Sri Lanka and the Maldives recently concluded an online children\u2019s art competition titled \u2018Art for Peace\u2019 as part of the celebrations of the Europe Day.",
    "An award ceremony was held on 2 June at the EU Delegation premises to acknowledge and recognize the young winning artists. This interactive activity was aimed at engaging with as many children as possible and to let them showcase their talent, while at the same time raising awareness about the EU and show how art can bring people together around the theme of peace.",
    "The competition was held online for children in three age categories: 6-8 years; 9-11 years; 12-15 years. Contestants were given the opportunity to submit one entry of original, unassisted, hand-drawn artwork, created without using digital tools. The contest generated a lot of interest and over 750 entries of inspiring artworks were received during the month of April from children across Sri Lanka and the Maldives.",
