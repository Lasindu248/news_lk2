  "body_lines": [
    "Lanka IOC has issued a statement on a fake document in circulation, with city-wise mobile numbers for the customers to convey their fuel requirements.",
    "The company said it categorically denies the reports circulated in social media and some sections of media pertaining to this fake document.",
    "It states that the customers would be informed via an SMS as soon as petrol consignments arrive at IOC filling stations.",
    "Accordingly, the customers have been asked to contact the contact number for their respective residential area in order to receive the SMS as petrol stocks in possession of Lanka IOC are limited.",
    "However, the IndianOil\u2019s subsidiary in Sri Lanka has stressed that there is no veracity in this communiqu\u00e9."
