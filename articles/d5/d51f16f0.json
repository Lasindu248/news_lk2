    "Several social activist groups today staged a demonstration opposite the Fort Railway Station denouncing the use of tobacco, smoking cigarettes and the companies that produce them. They said the tobacco manufacturing companies are the main culprits that send several millions of local revenue out of the country. They reiterated that large amounts of money could be saved if people stop smoking. Pix by Waruna Wanniarachchi"
