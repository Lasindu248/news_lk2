    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka main opposition MP Harsha de Silva lambasted the government on Thursday (24) over the absence of Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and officials of the monetary board during a key debate on amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act.",
    "A visibly irate de Silva told parliament Thursday morning that Cabraal and the other Central Bank officials\u2019 refusal to attend parliament as requested by the Committee on Public Finances was an insult to the legislature, the sole authority on matters of public finance in the country.",
    "On Wednesday (23), the public finances committee approved amendments to the VAT Act no 14 of 2002 which was to be taken up for debate the next day. The amendment bill provides for VAT on financial services from 15 percent to 18 percent effective from January 01, 2022.",
    "\u201cThe chairman had asked Cabraal and the monetary board to attend. They were first supposed to come on Monday but asked for Friday. I was supposed to respond.",
    "\u201cThey didn\u2019t come today. They sent a fax at 10.45am saying they\u2019re not coming today. Who\u2019s the authority here?\u201d asked de Silva.",
    "Citing article 148 of the constitution, the MP said parliament has full control over public finance and, as such, there was no point in holding an all-party conference to discuss Sri Lanka\u2019s prevailing economic crisis.",
    "The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB), which de Silva represents in parliament, were among a number of opposition parties that boycotted Wednesday\u2019s all party conference.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no point having conferences here and there. This problem can only be solved in parliament. The president has no power to make laws. Only parliament can increase taxes, reduce expenditure, etc.\u201d",
    "\u201cCabraal and co\u2019s absence today is a total insult to parliament. No one has the right to do that. What on earth is the point of this parliament then?\u201d demanded the MP.",
    "The Colombo district parliamentarian also took Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa to task for not being present in parliament during one of the worst economic crises in the country\u2019s history.",
    "\u201cThe finance minister doesn\u2019t show up. He doesn\u2019t answer questions. He hasn\u2019t come in three months,\u201d the MP said.",
    "de Silva also referred to unconfirmed speculation that a state bank has defaulted \u2013 speculation that was swiftly denied by the Central Bank Thursday afternoon.",
    "Sri Lanka banking system stable, state banks operating smoothly: Central bank",
    "\u201cWhat are we supposed to do? We can\u2019t have discussions at the president\u2019s palace and solve this problem. That place doesn\u2019t have legal responsibility. An all-party conference is not legally binding,\u201d he said.",
    "The solution to the crisis can only be found in parliament, he said.",
    "\u201cParliament has total power on public finance. The country will go into the abyss. This cannot be saved. You need a backbone. Questions must be answered,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar24/2022)"
