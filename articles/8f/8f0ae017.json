    "ECONOMYNEXT- Sri Lanka\u2019s police chief C D Wickramaratne on Tuesday said former Attorney General Dappula De Livera is bound to answer questions over suspicions created by his remarks last year when he retired from the position.",
    "The police chief\u2019s comments come as head of Sri Lanka\u2019s Catholic Church Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has alleged a conspiracy by unnamed parties in allowing the 2019 Easter Sunday attack to take place with the aim to back a political party at coming election.",
    "The accusation came after an allegedly long delay in justice to the victims and their families from a probe under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa government.",
    "Former AG De Livera in May last year has said that information by the State Intelligence Service, \u201cwith times, targets, places, method of attack and other information is clear evidence there was a grand conspiracy in place with regard to the April 21 2019 attack.\u201d",
    "Police chief Wickremeratne said De Livera has a \u201cduty\u201d to make the public aware of any existing \u201cevidence that the attacks were a political conspiracy.\u201d",
    "\u201cDe Livera has no new evidence. He had to have analysed the already available records that are piled up to a four foot height and summarised that information to come to the conclusion that this is a political conspiracy,\u201d Wickremeratne told reporters in Colombo.",
    "\u201cIt is his duty as the former Attorney General to think about the people of the country, especially the Cardinal and other Christians, and other people impacted by this, and present the facts of the case, if not to the Police, then to the Cardinal.\u201d",
    "Christians have been demanding justice for those killed in the Easter Sunday attack three years ago and have raised concerns over the government\u2019s slow progress and delay in releasing some of the presidential commission reports. The authorities finally released the reports\u00a0 in February ahead of a UN human rights session.",
    "The Cardinal has already taken the government\u2019s delay to the Vatican and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).",
    "Political analysts say contradictory statements by government leaders have given rise to concerns over the investigations.",
    "Separately, opposition legislators Harin Fernando raised questions over former Public Security Minister Sarath Weerasekera allegedly using the same vehicle used by terror leader Zaharan Hashim. Weerasekera said the vehicle was confiscated and is now under the custody of the elite police.",
    "In April last year, Weerasekara said Maulavi (Islamic preacher) Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed Naufer and another Islamic leader Rasheed Hajjul Akbar had been identified as the only confirmed masterminds of the attack. However, Hajjul Akbar has been already granted court bail.",
    "Tuesday\u2019s comments by the police chief also come amid intensified protests against President Rajapaksa, demanding that he step down, over his handling of Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis. Meanwhile, the third anniversary of the Easter Sunday attack falls on Thursday.",
    "Cardinal Ranjith has expressed his solidarity with the protestors demanding justice for the victims of the Easter attack and that the government step down as it has \u201cfailed in governance\u201d.",
    "Wickramaratne said the Cardinal had the authority to forward a written request for information through his lawyers to the Attorney General, who is bound to provide answers, \u201cunless the information could impact national security\u201d."
