    "The power interruptions that are currently being implemented on a daily basis will no longer be applicable to factories functioning under the Investment Promotion Board (IPB), which play an important role in the Sri Lankan economy, Power Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said.",
    "The BOI promotion officials pointed out that there are about 14 trade zones in the country that are functioning under the Board of Investment Promotion. Due to daily power cuts, the functionalities of many of these factories have been disrupted, and as a result, investor arrivals in the country are also being hampered.",
    "They also claimed that if investors stop coming in and evading making investment, the country could lose about US$ 800,000 worth of export earnings annually.",
    "Therefore, the Minister has advised the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) not to impose power cuts due to the prevailing dry weather conditions and fuel shortages. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
