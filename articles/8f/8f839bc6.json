Arbitration is a form of alternate dispute resolution process used worldwide to resolve business disputes.",
    "The Seminar is a concept of the ICC SL Chairman Shanil Fernando, who himself is a qualified Arbitration lawyer.

ICC arbitration brings international standards that are accepted in more than 90 countries.",
