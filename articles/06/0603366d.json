    "Microsoft Imagine Cup is designed to inspire students to use their imagination and passion for technology to create innovative solutions that tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest social, environmental, and health challenges.",
    "\u201cOur Imagine Cup competition is a great example of the possibilities,\u201d said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. \u201cFor 20 years, students have shown us what\u2019s possible when they come together to apply technology to help solve the world\u2019s challenges.\u201d",

    "Many children with learning disorders struggle in school long before being diagnosed. A learning disorder is an information-processing problem that prevents a person from learning a skill and using it effectively. As a result, the disorder appears as a gap between expected skills, based on age and intelligence, and academic performance.",
    "\u201cWe live in a world where technology can address various problems. Nana Shilpa helps to eliminate the delay in learning disability discovery using localized languages. It captures input from a mobile device and processes it using advanced machine learning and computer vision algorithms. If a child is diagnosed positive for a learning disability, the app then provides curated activities to mitigate the condition,\u201d Kalpani discloses.",

With Nana Shilpa, we can cut that to just 60 dollars. We are on a mission to help every kid in the world to read and write.\u201d",
