    "The Commercial Bank of Ceylon and the country\u2019s leading life insurer Ceylinco Life have collaborated to enable policyholders of Ceylinco Life to make premium payments through the Bank\u2019s Q+ Payment App and its island-wide network of Cash Recycler Machines (CRMs).",
    "With this development, Ceylinco Life policyholders can pay their insurance premiums conveniently and securely from anywhere, 24\u00d77 and 365 days of the year, the Bank said. The payments will also be validated in real time and updated on the same day.",
    "The Bank said the continuing digitisation of payments is particularly timely and significant, considering that safety and convenience are the topmost priorities on the minds of customers, especially in the backdrop of the pandemic-related risks associated with physical contact.",
    "Ceylinco Life policyholders can pay their premium dues via their smartphones by simply downloading the Q+ Payment App from the App Store or Google Play Store, signing up by filling in the required details (User ID and e-mail) and creating a Q+ Payment App account. In order to enable premium payments, policyholders have to link their ComBank Credit, Debit or Prepaid Cards to the App, click on the \u2018Bill Payment\u2019 menu on the App, select \u2018Ceylinco Life\u2019 as the service provider and insert the required details.",
    "Customers can also save their recurring premium payments under the \u2018Favourites\u2019 tab to avoid re-entering billing account numbers. Since a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is required to authenticate bill payments, the entire process is hassle free and secure.",
    "Alternatively, policyholders can also visit any one of the 275 Commercial Bank CRMs across the country, select \u2018Cardless Deposits\u2019 on the machine\u2019s home screen, select insurance payments to Ceylinco Life under the \u2018Bill Payments\u2019 option and proceed to pay their dues within a matter of minutes, the Bank said.",
