    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The protest which was carried out by the people at Mirihana yesterday (31) was infiltrated by those who came with the man who actually set fire to a bus during the protest, alleges Samagi Jana Balawegaya MP Manusha Nanayakkara.",
    "Speaking during a press conference today (01), the MP pointed out that the Presidential Media Unit was even able to identify the people which it labeled \u2018extremists\u2019, very soon after the protest, while it alleged that some of these extremists were carrying iron rods and other equipment.",
    "However, none of the pictures taken at the protest showed anyone holding iron rods, machetes or any other equipment, the MP said, adding that their only weapons were the chants demanding that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa leave.",
    "MP Nanayakkara also demanded whether the protestors were labeled extremists merely for shouting expletives at the protest.",
    "\u201cWhat kind of an extremist group was this? We definitely suspect that these extremists are Rajapaksa extremists. We would like to state at this juncture that an organized operation is being carried out to sabotage the trust in the opposition that is building up among these people, while it is also an operation aiming to sabotage the April 3rd protests,\u201d MP Nanayakkara also stated.",
    "However, questions remain whether who was the main who set the bus on fire, the group that came with it, and who is the mastermind behind it, he added.",
    "Who\u2019s the real mastermind behind Thursday\u2019s (31) violence ? \u2013 Manusha",
    "Those who incited violence during Mirihana Protests are political extremists \u2013 Govt Min."
