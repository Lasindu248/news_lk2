    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) today said its MPs had already begun placing signatures for an impeachment motion against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa while the placing of signatures for the no confidence motion against the government is also continuing.",
    "SJB MP Rajitha Senaratne told a press conference that the impeachment motion against the President is underway while the placing of signatures for the no faith motion is also continuing. \u201cThese are components of a programme which the party has devised to take the nation out of the present political crisis,\u201d Dr. Senaratne said.",
    "\u201cSJB does not aim to remove the incumbent President alone but has prepared a plan which goes beyond an impeachment motion. We plan to go for constitutional reforms under which Executive Powers will be shared by a new President and the legislature. We also propose the repealing of the 20th Amendment and to rectify the shortcomings of the 19th Amendment as a short-term measure,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSJB will only work towards forming a multiparty interim government only if the other parties representing the House agree with our proposals,\u201d he added.",
    "Meanwhile a group of MPs who gave official statements to journalists before the press conference including Dr. Kavinda Jayawardana said SJB MPs have begun placing their signatures to both the no faith motion and the impeachment motion.",
    "\u201cThe course of action which we have proposed is a way forward for the legislature to resolve the present political crisis and we hope that all MPs will support us. We also don\u2019t want to support those who want President Gotabaya Rajapaksa but enjoy a good rapport with Prime Minister Rajapaksa and those who are against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa but good with other Rajapaksas,\u201d MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha told journalists.",
    "Asked whether there are any divisions within the SJB, MP Mujibur Rahman denied these reports. \u201cWe are all working together,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera)"
