With our commitment to SBTi, we have gained even greater competitive advantages, which align with the rising consumer demand for more sustainable brands,\u201d South Asia Textiles and Hayleys Fabric Managing Director/CEO Rohan Goonetilleke said.",
    "SBTi specifies how much and how quickly a company needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement goals to limit global warming keeping it at 1.5\u00b0C and well below 2\u00b0C and is also part of a broader effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",

Crucially, significant positive environmental sustainability initiatives undertaken will support the company\u2019s commitment to SBTi.",
    "Launched in collaboration with CDP Worldwide, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Targets are globally recognised commitments that companies make as part of the We Mean Business Coalition\u2019s Take Action platform on climate change.",
    "As part of its commitments, SAT also recently obtained the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications for elevating its environmental sustainability and employee health and safety systems on par with global best practices.",
    "In pursuit of these certifications, the company made significant investments towards the upgrade its effluent water treatment plant, including installing a high-quality raw water filtration unit. Moreover, the company formed environment, health, and safety (EHS) teams representing all departments to update and enhance EHS protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and conduct comprehensive training and awareness sessions.",
