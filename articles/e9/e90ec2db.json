  "body_lines": [
    "Australia\u2019s center-left opposition party toppled the conservative government after almost a decade in power, and Prime Minister-elect Anthony Albanese in his Saturday election victory speech promised sharper reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while he faces an early foreign policy test.",
    "Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he quickly conceded defeat despite millions of votes yet to be counted because an Australian leader must attend a Tokyo summit on Tuesday with U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
    "Albanese, who has described himself as the only candidate with a \u201cnon-Anglo Celtic name\u201d to run for prime minister in the 121 years that the office has existed, referred to his own humble upbringing in the Sydney suburb of Camperdown.",
    "\u201cIt says a lot about our great country that a son of a single mom who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing down the road in Camperdown can stand before you tonight as Australia\u2019s prime minister,\u201d Albanese said.",
    "\u201cEvery parent wants more for the next generation than they had. My mother dreamt of a better life for me. And I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars,\u201d he added.",
    "Albanese will be sworn in as prime minister after his Labor party clinched its first electoral win since 2007.",
    "Labor has promised more financial assistance and a robust social safety net as Australia grapples with the highest inflation since 2001 and soaring housing prices.",
    "The party also plans to increase minimum wages, and on the foreign policy front, it proposed to establish a Pacific defense school to train neighboring armies in response to China\u2019s potential military presence on the Solomon Islands on Australia\u2019s doorstep.",
    "It also wants to tackle climate change with a more ambitious 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.",
    "Morrison\u2019s Liberal party-led coalition was seeking a fourth three-year term. It held the narrowest of majorities \u2014 76 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives, where parties need a majority to form a government. In early counting on Saturday, the coalition was on track to win 51 seats, Labor 72, 10 were unaligned lawmakers and 18 were too close to call.",
    "The major parties bled votes to fringe parties and independents, which increases the likelihood of a hung parliament and a minority government.",
    "Australia most recent hung parliaments were from 2010-13, and during World War II.",
    "The minor Australian Greens party appeared to have increased its representation from a single seat to three.",
    "The Greens supported a Labor minority government in 2010, and will likely support a Labor administration again if the party falls short of a 76-seat majority.",
    "As well as campaigning against Labor, Morrison\u2019s conservative Liberals fought off a new challenge from so-called teal independent candidates to key government lawmakers\u2019 reelection in party strongholds.",
    "At least four Liberal lawmakers appeared to have lost their seats to teal independents including Liberal Party deputy leader Josh Frydenberg, who had been considered Morrison\u2019s most likely successor.",
    "\u201cWhat we have achieved here is extraordinary,\u201d teal candidate and former foreign correspondent Zoe Daniels said in her victory speech. \u201cSafe Liberal seat. Two-term incumbent. Independent,\u201d she added.",
    "The teal independents are marketed as a greener shade than the Liberal Party\u2019s traditional blue color and want stronger government action on reducing Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions than either the government or Labor are proposing.",
    "The government\u2019s Senate leader Simon Birmingham was concerned by big swings toward several teal candidates.",
    "\u201cIt is a clear problem that we are losing seats that are heartland seats, that have defined the Liberal Party for generations,\u201d Birmingham said.",
    "\u201cIf we lose those seats \u2014 it is not certain that we will \u2014 but there is clearly a big movement against us and there is clearly a big message in it,\u201d Birmingham added.",
    "Due to the pandemic, around half of Australia\u2019s 17 million electors have voted early or applied for postal votes, which will likely slow the count.",
    "Early polling for reasons of travel or work began two weeks ago and the Australian Electoral Commission will continue collecting postal votes for another two weeks."
