    "Sri Lanka Railways has decided to operate several long-distance trains from today (May 14), General Manager of Railways Dhammika Jayasundara says.",
    "Railway services were interrupted over the past few days due to the island-wide curfew order that came into effect amidst the unrest that broke out on Monday (May 09) following an attack on anti-government protesters by the ruling party supporters.",
    "Trains will be up and running as per usual after the curfew order is lifted, the railways chief noted."
