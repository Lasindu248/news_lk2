    "Health officials state that booster dose coverage among the target population has exceeded 50%, adding that COVID-19 vaccinations were administered to 26,028 persons on Thursday.",
    "According to Health Promotion Bureau Director Dr. Ranjith Batuwanthudawa, 51% of the target population has received the booster dose. He added that exceeding 50% coverage was significant.",
    "\u201cA drop in COVID-19 detections can be seen at present and we believe that the high percentage of booster coverage has contributed to this,\u201d Dr. Batuwanthudawa went on to say.",
    "According to him, the administration of the first vaccine dose to children over 12 years and the second vaccine dose to children over 16 years is currently taking place.",
    "Colombo University Medical Faculty Senior Professor and Paediatrician Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe explained that the technical committee is currently collecting relevant data on vaccination of the under-12 age group. Global data must be analysed before a decision is made, he said.",
    "\u201cOn the other hand, we must also see if there is a significant adverse effect on the child if they are not vaccinated and because there is no significant impact, we have been gradually lowering the age limit,\u201d Dr. Wickramasinghe said, explaining that it was important to balance both these aspects to vaccination, especially when administering a newly-developed vaccine to children.",
    "According to the Family Health Bureau, there has been a good response for vaccination of school children within the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area. Officer in Charge of the Bureau\u2019s School Health Unit Narahenpita Dr. Jayalath said that vaccination is yet to be carried out in just 20 schools within the CMC area but that this too, will be completed in the next 14 days.",
    "He explained that 50% of the total children have been vaccinated. \u201cHowever, I believe this number is much higher as our unit is not the only one carrying out vaccination. Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children administers vaccines daily from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and the number of school children vaccinated there is not included in our numbers,\u201d Dr. Jayalath said.",
    "As of 2 March, 79.3% of the population aged 16 to 19 years had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Epidemiology Unit adds that 95.8% of the population over 12 years has received the first vaccine dose and 80.4% has received the second dose as well.",
