He steered the session shaping the learning and ideas of the young and upcoming journalists in the Media and communications stream in the Universities to pursue investigative journalism in the future.",
    "Dilrukshi Handunetti said: \u201cInvestigative journalism is about speaking truth to power\u201d and contributing to achieve justice. She discussed how journalists should not become the story and be able to cover the stories that are out there. By citing renowned female investigative reporters like Rana Ayyub from India, Rozina Islam from Bangladesh and Sheila Coronel from the Philippines, Handunetti shed light on the difficulties female investigative journalists go through in the face of adversity.",
    "In the meantime, well-known data journalist Shihar Aneez highlighted that: \u201cImportance of data is not only in numbers, but information shared.\u201d Rifthi Ali further highlighted how important it is to be aware about the Right to Information Act as a journalist in Sri Lanka and how useful it is in journalism. He said \u201cDo not be fearful of RTI. Use RTI and find your data\u201d.",
    "The InSPIRE university students had many questions about investigative journalism. They asked about security and protection of investigative journalists and whether there are special mechanisms and laws to protect them; the female investigative journalists, Muslim female investigative journalists and their protection, how female investigative journalists should behave in the field; how dissemination of data and useful information is being done, what are the initiatives taken to disseminate useful information; and whether government data can be trusted.",
    "The panel discussion on investigative journalism shed a light on the university students on how to renounce passivity in journalism and actively involved in reporting.",
    "Chinthaka Sadaruwan from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura said: \u201cI learned a lot of things today. Mainly, what is investigative journalism and our responsibility as upcoming journalists. How to do investigative journalism inspired me to use this in my career in the future.\u201d",
    "This session was part of the InSPIRE Annual Forum, which was organised by Helvetas Sri Lanka and LDJF, on the theme, LEARN. SHARE. CONNECT \u2013 Diversifying Learning Through Synergies. The overall objectives of the Annual Forum are to provide: a platform for Knowledge building and information exchange and an opportunity for cross fertilisation of ideas and enable peer-to-peer learning.",
    "The panel discussion was followed by two practical sessions on: \u201cLive Streaming\u201d by Alexshanther Kamilas; and Right to Information (RTI) Act by Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL). The RTI session was a very meaningful and informative session as the students were made knowledgeable about the Act and how to file an RTI.",
    "Overall, the entire program spread the vibe of learning by sharing. The students from University of Peradeniya were from the Agriculture Extension Faculty. They were undergraduates who are part of the Journalism Club in the University. For them this was a novel experience. Owin Amaratunga from the University of Peradeniya said: \u201cI had no prior knowledge in journalism. I was able to learn what are the different types of journalism, Live Streaming and RTI. The RTI session was very informative. We were able to interact with students from different universities as well as different study areas. We were able to share ideas and discuss as groups during the day. It was very useful. So, in the future, I plan to share the knowledge gained today with my family and my university community.\u201d",
    "Ogochucki Emanuela, a Nigerian student who is with the University of Peradeniya as an Exchange student shared her experience. She said: \u201cThis is a very insightful session. I learned about the concept of investigative journalism and what is the correct way to be a journalist. I remember What Ms. Dilrukshi Handunetti said about being a journalist, she said \u2018you should not be the journalist who takes selfies with people but be the journalist who people want to take selfies with\u2019.\u201d"
