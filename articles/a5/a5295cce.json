    "CODA star Troy Kotsur made history at the Academy Awards on Sunday night.",
    "With his victory for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Kotsur became the first deaf male actor to win an Oscar, and the second deaf performer to win overall. The first was none other than his CODA costar and on-screen wife Marlee Matlin, who won Best Actress 35 years ago for her role in the 1986 film Children of a Lesser God.",
    "Upon accepting the award, Kotsur brought his trademark charm to the Oscars stage. \u201cThis is amazing to be here on this journey. I cannot believe I\u2019m here. Thank you so much to all the members of the Academy for recognizing my work,\u201d he said, before telling the audience about his trip to the White House recently with his fellow CODA cast members.",
    "He then went on to thank deaf theaters for fostering his career, and, quoting Steven Spielberg, called director Sian Heder \u201cthe best communicator\u201d for bringing the deaf and hearing community together. And, in a moment that brought his interpreter to tears, he shared a sweet story about his father.",
