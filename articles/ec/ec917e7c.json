    "A group of lawyers led by President\u2019s Counsel Maithri Gunaratne today sought an order directing the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle from leaving the country.",
    "This application was made in connection with a private plaint filed against former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal. Mr. Gunaratne submitted to the court that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle could be named as the key witnesses over an incident where Cabraal has taken measures to pay a 500 million US dollar international sovereign bond.",
    "However, Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala rejected the application citing that the court would not consider such an order in respect of witnesses at this juncture.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Maithri Gunaratne submitted to the Court that Ajith Nivard Cabraal is responsible for the country's crippling economic crisis since he took measures to pay a 500 million US dollar sovereign bond. He told the court that there is a possibility of naming former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa as a witness or a suspect in this regard. He contended that Basil Rajapaksa is about to leave the island and he should be prevented from leaving the country taking into account his dual citizenship status.",
    "Meanwhile, the Court further extended its order preventing former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal from leaving the country until May 2.",
    "President\u2019s Counsel Maithree Goonaratne, Counsel Ashan Nanayakkara, Iresh Seneviratne and Chan Godakumbura appeared for the complainant. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)"
