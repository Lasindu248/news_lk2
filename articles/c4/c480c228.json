    "I was compelled to revoke my resignation as the Finance Minister as no one was willing to take over the ministry, Minister Ali Sabry told Parliament today.",
    "\u201cNo one was willing to take over the ministry as everyone is feared to face the criticism given the current precarious situation. I am willing to remain as the Minister of Finance and do the needful in order to save the country\u2019s economy no matter what challenges I might have to face,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI am aware that I am on my last days in politics but I will do what has to be done,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhat is needed today is to introduce ways and means to ensure an increased dollar revenue. I am grateful to SLPP MPs who remain with the ruling party and are trying to safeguard the government,\u201d he also said.",
    "Minister Sabry said the Sri Lankan government should have re-examined the tax revisions which were introduced during December 2019 when the pandemic hit the nation in early 2020s.",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has no time to waste unlike Pakistan whose foreign reserves are stable. I would not like to mention about Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves level. One should not create unrest while peaceful protests are harmful. If you can show a majority in the House we are willing to sit in the opposition and hand over the reins to you,\u201d he also said.",
    "He was hopeful of getting debt moratoria and said Sri Lanka can no longer go for sovereign bonds given the debt situation. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
