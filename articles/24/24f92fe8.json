    "IMED has announced the appointment of well-known professional T.M.P.G. Tennakoon as the Chief Operating Officer.",
    "IMED was established as a Centre of Excellence in Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship Development in the Asia Pacific region and launched its Sri Lankan operations in October 2021.",
    "IMED believes promoting Financial Literacy and fostering Entrepreneurship as the key drivers of poverty alleviation and sustainable development of a nation. The institute has already lined up several initiatives in addition to a wide range of capacity building programs among aspiring and existing entrepreneurs with a special focus on SMEs and family businesses.",
    "\u201cOur aim is to be the catalyst in building an entrepreneurship ecosystem within the country and thereby support sustainable and inclusive economic development. At present only around 3% of the Sri Lankan population are entrepreneurs of some form and even among them there is a significant level of underperformance due to lack of proper skills, technology and guidance. We must have a national target to increase the entrepreneurs at least up to 7.5% \u2013 10% of the population within the next five years, while also enhancing the productivity of the existing entrepreneurs. We are already receiving overwhelming responses from many parties who are passionate about fostering entrepreneurship to join hands with us and we intend to roll out a few national initiatives very soon. On behalf of the Governing Board of IMED, I warmly welcome Tennakoon as the Chief Operating Officer and I wish him the best of his efforts to drive the organisation towards its intended vision, stated IMED Founder/President Chaaminda Kumarasiri.",

Over the last 16 years he has been heavily involved in the Professional Education sector, while dealing with many local and international bodies and experts.
