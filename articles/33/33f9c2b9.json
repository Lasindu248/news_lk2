    "Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has called for a party leaders\u2019 meeting on Thursday to discuss constitutional reforms.",
    "Speaker Abeywardena in a letter addressed to the Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa had informed him about the meeting.",
    "\u201cI have received your proposal for the constitutional reforms and the 22nd Amendment handed over to me by the 40 members who became independent. However since the amendment submitted by your party is a private members motion, it will be a time consuming affair to get it approved,\" the speaker told the Leader of Opposition in his letter.",
    "\"However I have submitted both proposals to the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet which has to refer the proposals to the Attorney General. I cannot work against the constitution,\" he also said in the letter. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
