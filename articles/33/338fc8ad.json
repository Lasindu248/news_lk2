    "Samagi Jana Balavegaya MP Hector Appuhamy noted in a parliamentary speech on Thursday that Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned on May 9 and Basil Rajapaksa quit exactly a month later on June 9. He then posed the rhetorical question: Will Gotabaya Rajapaksa step down on July 9? Apparently not. The president was very clear on this in what was described as a \u201cwide-ranging\u201d interview he granted the Bloomberg news agency last week. This was the first such since the smelly stuff hit the fan several weeks ago, bringing not only the Rajapaksas but the whole country to their knees. GR said clearly and unequivocally that he can\u2019t (or won\u2019t?) quit as \u201ca failed president\u201d adding that he will not run again. He is determined, at least right now, to complete his two remaining years.",
    "The \u2018Gota Go Home\u2019 demand remains alive and kicking. The queues for fuel and gas are as interminable as they ever were. The power cuts are very much a fact of life. The prices of essentials continue to go through the roof and many everyday needs are either scarce or simply unobtainable. Though we hear, particularly from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, that the situation remains grim and will become worse, there are no solutions on the table. The only pluses are generous assistance from India and engagement with the IMF. Most people will not buy JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s claim that Wickremesinghe is exaggerating the economic crisis \u201cto cover up his own failure.\u201d Wickremesinghe did not come into office with a magic wand. He was invited to takeover when the Rajapaksas were at the end of their tether. Dissanayake is right to the extent that the PM\u2019s statements may add to the queues on the fear of worse to come.",
    "Also in Parliament on Thursday, Wimal Weerawansa said that the events of May 9 were only a rehearsal of what will follow. Next time it will not only be the property and businesses of politicians that will be attacked. The whole affluent class is at risk, he darkly predicted. If hunger \u2013 or worse famine \u2013 hits, that is more probable than possible. He further asked what would happen if we are unable to feed our security forces. But as regular columnist Rajan Philips says on this page, the country picture appears very much to be \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d Unfortunately nobody asked Basil Rajapaksa whether he has plans to renounce his U.S. citizenship. It was as clear as daylight when the 20th Amendment was enacted, that the clause enabling dual citizen to hold public office was intended for Basil\u2019s return to Parliament where he succeeded brother Mahinda as finance minister. Admitting that the Rajapaksas were better at politics than at government, BR answered in the affirmative when asked whether he\u2019d be visiting the U.S. saying his family, including a grandson, were in that country.",
    "Granting that the president is serious about an All Party government to tide over the crisis, why did the government elect its own nominee to chair the Public Finance Committee when the SJB wanted Dr. Harsha de Silva, who\u2019s ability to do the job is unquestionable, to be given the job. If the SJB is ironclad on its decision to stay out of the government unless there\u2019s a definite timeline set for GR\u2019s departure, at least competent opposition politicians could be appointed to parliamentary watchdog committees where they can make useful contributions. Fending accusations of \u201cunderhand\u201d tactics to have a government parliamentarian elected to chair the committee, Speaker Abeywardene said that the matter could be raised by the party leaders and a replacement agreed upon. It remains to be seen whether the SLPP will relent and permit an opposition nominee to serve as committee chair. The prime minister who owes his position to the SLPP is said to have preferred an opposition chair. But what influence does he have over the MPs who enthroned him? The recent election of the deputy speaker is sorry evidence of the papadam is crumbling.",
    "At Basil Rajapaksa\u2019s farewell press conference, the question on whether business tycoon Dhammika Perera would take his National List vacancy was fired. Rumours to this effect were swirling and a report that Perera had obtained SLPP membership remained uncontradicted. BR didn\u2019t say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 but looked at SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam flanking him and said it was a matter for the party. Readers may remember that Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Dhammika Perera Secretary to the Transport Ministry some years ago. He didn\u2019t make any waves in that job and eased out of the position seemingly on his own volition. But he\u2019s gone public with the opinion that much can be done from seat of the Secretary Finance implying that\u2019s a job he\u2019d like to take. Obviously finance minister would be even better.",
    "The country will soon know what\u2019s in store through the forthcoming constitutional amendment. Though Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe calls it 21A, the TNA\u2019s M.A. Sumanthiran says \u2018No.\u2019 21A is what the SJB has already tabled in the House. As he said in a well received parliamentary speech we run today, ours now is a peculiar Parliament with big chunks of the government sitting as \u201cIndependents\u201d in the opposition. These MPs are neither fish, flesh or fowl and acting on their own personal agendas. The prospects of any solution to the horrific crisis gripping the nation being delivered by the incumbent Parliament seems remote and an election far off. This, after all, is a land like no other where a prime minister who resigned attends cabinet meetings. And a minister sentenced to jail by a competent court continues to sit in the cabinet.",
