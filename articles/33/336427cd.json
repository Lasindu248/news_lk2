    "\u201cIt has been stressed to Government of Sri Lanka that the development of infrastructure in Sri Lanka in areas such as ports and energy with foreign investment from India would be a mutually beneficial proposition, especially since most of the transshipment at Colombo Port is to and from India,\u201d the minister noted.",
