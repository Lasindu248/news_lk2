    "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said he would go for a dialogue with China to secure major assistance.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe who was speaking to WION India said he will talk to China shortly to get that nation included in a donor conference which Sri Lanka is trying hold in the future.",
    "\u201cChina has been assisting us to some extent but major assistance that was to come did not come our way as we were working with India.",
    "I am trying to have a dialogue with China shortly and try to get them included in a donor conference which we intend to hold soon,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said.",
    "It was reported earlier that China has turned down a request for US$ 1.5 billion currency SWAP. Also he said India had come forward to help Sri Lanka at a difficult time where the former had no formal plan to purchase essentials.",
    "\u201cI would like to thank Prime Minister Modi for his help. I have also had a long chat with the Indian Foreign Minister and is also working on it,\u201d he added.",
    "Responding to a question as to whether there are differences between him and the SLPP, Mr. Wickremesinghe said there are divisions within the SLPP over certain issues.",
    "\u201cSome SLPP members voted against the Electricity Amendment Bill while some members of the cabinet wanted more time to study the 21st Amendment.",
    "However, the backbencher MPs of both government and the opposition are backing me and I will continue the dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an independent Prime Minister.",
    "I accepted the premiership following a request from some former Ministers and current MPs from SLPP and some MPs from SJB. I had to accept the post as no one else was willing to do so. Leader of Opposition should have accepted it when it was offered,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera)"
