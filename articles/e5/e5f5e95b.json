    "Import expenditure continued to expand, in spite of high earnings from exports exceeding US dollars 1.0 billion for the eighth consecutive month, thereby widening the deficit in the trade account in January 2022, compared to January 2021. Tourist arrivals showed a notable recovery in January 2022 over the same month in the previous year, while moderation of workers\u2019 remittances was observed in January 2022.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka successfully settled the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of US dollars 500 million in January 2022. The financial account of the balance of payments strengthened during the month with the receipt of the SAARCFINANCE swap facility from the Reserve Bank of India. The weighted average spot exchange rate, which remained in Rs. 200-203 range in January, adjusted upwards with greater flexibility allowed in the exchange rate with effect from 07.03.2022. (CBSL)",
