    "The diversified blue-chip Aitken Spence PLC reported a profit before tax of Rs. 14.2 billion for the twelve months ended 31st March 2022 compared to the loss reported before tax of Rs. 2.8 billion last year. This phenomenal performance was driven by the Group\u2019 diverse presence in eight countries spanning sixteen segments of operation. The diversity of the Group\u2019s operations and the transformational leadership and rigorous management of processes and costs showcased by all segments in achieving these results are testimony to the Group\u2019s ability to perform even under trying socio-economic conditions.The asset rich Aitken Spence Group grew its total asset base by 34.3% during the year to Rs. 197.3 billion at year end, with Rs. 127.9 billion of these assets being non-current assets, predominantly property, plant and equipment. The diversity of the Group is further augmented by the fact that 46.7% of those total assets are from overseas operations. Aitken Spence net assets per share stood at Rs. 162.44 as of 31st March 2022, which is a 33.3% growth over the previous year.",
