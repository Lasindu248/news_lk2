  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Police cannot simply stand aside and watch if a bowser caught fire and many died, and if it did happen, the Police would have to field allegations as to why they simply stood aside and let 300 people die, said the newly-appointed Minister of Public Security, Prasanna Ranatunga.",
    "The Rambukkana incident was discussed in Parliament today (22), when SJB MP Lakshman Kiriella questioned the Minister on statements he previously made, and pointed out that the Attorney General\u2019s Department stands as the entity to find out the truth, and not to carry out the opinions of the Government.",
    "\u201cI did not say that. I mean, if the bowser caught fire and 300 people died, then allegation will come to the police as to why the police was keeping silent while people died,\u201d he stated.",
    "Minister Ranatunga further stated that he maintains the position that Policemen, who work for 10 to 15 hours a day, are human too, and need security as well.",
    "Moreover, he emphasized that the Secretary to the Ministry has been advised to work on the advice of the Attorney General\u2019s Department in every step of the way.",
    "Decision to fire weapon was taken outside IGP\u2019s direction: HRCSL"
