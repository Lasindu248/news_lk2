    "The SJB also stresses that the President should not interfere in any way with the all-party interim government.",
    "The executive presidency must be abolished within a minimum period of time, the SJB said further, adding that a parliamentary election should be held to establish a permanent government soon, after restoring stability in the country.",

He also said the public trust in the government has been breached.",
