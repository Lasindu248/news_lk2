    "\u201cMultiple factors are impacting Sri Lanka\u2019s food security situation; if we don\u2019t act now, many families will be unable to meet their basic food needs,\u201d UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka Hanaa Singer-Hamdy said in a statement.",
    "There was an \u201curgent need to prevent a humanitarian crisis later in the year, while bridging efforts towards development and socio-economic interventions.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka which earns a billion US dollars a month in exports and earns about 600 million US dollars in remittances, about half of which are coming to the recipients through unofficial channels boosting family incomes cannot find 25 million US dollars for medicines due to price controls and a broken peg.",

    "\u201cNow is the time for the international community to show solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cThe UN and humanitarian partners are calling on donors, the private sector and individuals to urgently support this plan to provide life-saving assistance to the women, men, and children most affected by the crisis and thus prevent a deterioration of humanitarian needs in the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka, formerly an upper-middle income country, is facing its worst economic crisis since independence,\u201d the UN said.",

    "Sri Lanka is facing the fate of many developing countries with economists who have rejected the classical economic principle of sound money and embraced the mercantilist principle of mis-using people\u2019s money for stimulus or export promotion by destroying real wages.",
    "\u201cThe days are gone in which most persons in authority considered stability of foreign exchange rates to be an advantage,\u201d wrote classical economist Ludwig von Mises after (mainly) post-Keynesian inflationist-devalationism conquered English speaking Western academic opinion.",
    "\u201cDevaluation of a country\u2019s currency has now become a regular means of restricting imports and expropriating foreign capital.",
