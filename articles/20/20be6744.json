    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 A magistrate court in Sri Lanka on Thursday ordered authorities to prevent former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal from leaving the country after a political activist filed a legal case against him over alleged misappropriation.",
    "The Colombo Magistrate Court issued the order to prevent Cabraal from leaving the country until April 18 after political activist Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon filed the case citing Cabraal\u2019s failure to disclose his relationship to some primary bond market stakeholders.",
    "Among six charges filed by Tennakoon against Cabraal is that the former central bank governor had incurred a 10.04 to 10.06 billion rupee loss to the government during his 2006-2015 tenure as the governor of the central bank.",
    "He was reappointed as central bank governor in mid-September last year when the signs of an economic crisis first appeared.",
    "Cabraal strongly opposed calls to seek International Monetary Fund assistance in addressing the financial crisis, and kept both interest and exchange rates artificially low amid excess money printing. The policy failure later created a severe shortage of dollars and the rupee has fallen nearly 60 percent since the currency was floated on March 07.",
    "Cabraal resigned from the post on Monday (04) after the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP) government\u2019s entire cabinet resigned the previous day. (Colombo/April 07/2022)"
