    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The Consumer Affairs Authority has requested the public not to stockpile rice in an unnecessary manner, and only to purchase the daily requirement.",
    "The CAA, in a press release, states that according to statistics, there is NO rice shortage in Sri Lanka at present. Moreover, in consideration of the rice stocks which are due to be received by Sri Lanka, and the projected harvest of the Yala season too will be added to the rice stocks of the country.",
    "Therefore, the Consumer Affairs Authority states that a short-term shortage was caused in the market due to some consumers attempting to unnecessarily accumulate goods.",
    "This causes high demand in the market, which eventually causes a price increase, the CAA states.",
    "Moreover, the CAA states that it has been conducting raids over non-presentation of prices and selling rice for prices higher than the stipulated amount."
