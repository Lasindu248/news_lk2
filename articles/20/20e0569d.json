    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation in the capital Colombo galloped to 29.8 percent in the 12-months to April 2022, accelerating from 18.7 percent in March data from the state statistics office showed, after two years of money printing and a botched float of the currency with a surrender rule,",
    "The Colombo Consumer Price Index grew 9.3 percent in the month from 164.9 points to 180.2 points as the rupee collapsed to around 360 rupees to the US dollar from 203 over two months.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing perhaps the worst monetary instability created by the island\u2019s bank in its 72 year history since a stable currency board was abolished in favour of a Latin America style agency with anchor conflicts.",
    "Price started to gallop from around July 2021 and the country also defaulted on its foreign debt after running out of reserves.",
    "Monetary policy deteriorated sharply after 2015 with flexible inflation targeting with output gap targeting (printing money to push growth up) triggering currency crises in quick succession.",
    "There are calls to set up a currency board and put the island\u2019s economists/Keynesians in a strait jacket so that they are unable to either depreciated the currency for trade gains at the expense of the welfare of the general populace or try to push growth up with money printing and blow the balance of payments apart.
