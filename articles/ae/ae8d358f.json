  "body_lines": [
    "The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR)) is working for the establishment of community-based committees at Grama Seva division levels to detect reasons for communal violence and take measures to pre-empt them, an official said.",
    "ONUR Director-General Deepthi Lamahewa told a group of journalists today that his office was working for evolving sustainable solutions to ensure harmony among different ethnic and communal groups in the country.",
    "He said the primary task of these community-based committees would be to give early warnings and rapid responses.",
    "Village level leaders such as representatives of mediation boards and Grama Niladharis would be included in these committees. Mr. Lamahewa said youths would play a vital role in the prevention of violence based on ethnicity and religion.",
    "\u201cSuch violence is mostly spontaneous reaction to incidents. Then, area youths have a role to play in the prevention of them. Otherwise, it is not that we play the role of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or the intelligence authorities,\u201d he said.",
    "The community based committees will liaise with the Divisional Secretaries in this task.",
    "The ONUR currently operates under the Justice Ministry. Minister Ali Sabry gives leadership to it.",
    "Besides, the ONUR is planning for the establishment of a similar mechanism to prevent violent extremism in the country. Mr. Lamahewa said it would not be a programme targeting any particular ethnic group.",
    "\u201cViolent extremism can be found in any society. Whatever it is, we want to prevent it from occurring,\u201d he said. (Kelum Bandara)"
