  "body_lines": [
    "The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) would not participate at the All- Party Conference (APC) convened by the President, as it was not meant to resolve the economic crisis but to resolve the political crisis within the government, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.",
    "He told a news conference that the APC was convened as a result of the discussion held between the President and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to iron out political differences within the government following the removal of two prominent Ministers.",
    "He said the proposal of convening the all party conference itself was wrong.",
    "Mr. Dissanayake said similar APC was convened by the President during the Covid pandemic and added that however, the government did not pay heed to the proposals of the Party leaders, but continued its own agenda.",
    "He also said the government has not revealed the depth and width of the economic crisis despite repeated requests.",
    "\"The government is yet to present in Parliament the report issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sri Lanka,\" he said.",
    "The JVP leader also said the government has convened the APC after the economic crisis had aggravated and pointed out that they had requested a joint proposal to the crisis situation one-and-a-half years ago.",
    "He said considering the above matters, they have decided to boycott the conference. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
