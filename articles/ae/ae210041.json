    "He made this invitation as the Chief Guest at the \u2018Forward, Together for the Nation\u2019 forum organised by the National Council of Professionals held at the BMICH.",
    "\u201cEveryone has to unite, mobilise our energies and capacities and make a strong determination to extricate our motherland from this quagmire,\u201d said Premadasa. He blamed the economic catastrophe on the hero-worshipping, refusal to listen to professional advice and knee jerk reactions by the Rajapaksa administration.",
    "Premadasa also mentioned the steps we have to take to get the country out of this maze that it is stuck in. He emphasised the need for a social democratic approach which gives credence to social-market economic features and inclusive growth.",
    "\u201cWe need to embark on a new modern path breaking industrialisation program,\u201d said Premadasa while mentioning that himself and SJB will strive towards building a Sri Lanka devoid of racism, discrimination and hate speech and making democracy victorious.",
    "He also assured that SJB will never resort to expedient temporary political arrangements to get perks and privileges. SJB will not betray the outcry of the people, reiterated Sajith while requesting everyone to join hands with SJB to embark on a new journey of hope, aspirations, achievements and progress."
