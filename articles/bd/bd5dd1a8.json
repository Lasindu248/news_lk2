  "body_lines": [
    "Fitch Ratings today warned that high investment and liquidity risks, pressure on regulatory capital positions and a likely worsening in financial performance have increased the near-term downside risks to Sri Lankan insurers' credit profiles.",
    "The assessment follows Fitch last week placing the national ratings of all of its rated Sri Lankan insurers on Rating Watch Negative.",
    "Fitch said the recent negative rating actions on the Sri Lanka sovereign and various financial\u00a0 institutions underscore the risks to domestic insurers, whose investment portfolios\u00a0 are dominated by fixed-income securities issued or guaranteed by the government,\u00a0 and deposits and securities issued by local banks, non-bank financial institutions\u00a0 and corporations.",
    "Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka's sovereign rating to 'C', from 'CC' and had placed the ratings of several financial institutions on Rating Watch\u00a0 Negative. Some insurers also have foreign-currency exposure via investments in Sri\u00a0 Lanka development bonds and deposits with local banks."
