  "title": "If private bowsers withdraw from fuel distribution, alternatives in place: Minister",
  "body_lines": [
    "Plans have been drawn to utilize alternative arrangements in the event the private sector bowsers withdraw from fuel distribution, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.",
    "He said fuel transportation is currently done by three parties, namely the bowsers registered under the government, those belong to filling station owners and bowsers owned by private sector.",
    "Charges have been revised five times for bowsers owned by the private sector since July last year.",
    "They also agreed to make a few more amendments, but later rejected them.",
    "\"The charge revisions must be made, so that the state-owned enterprise does not collapse financially and fuel distribution continues unabated. The unloading of diesel began last night, and unloading two petrol and crude oil tankers will also take place in the next couple of days,\" the Minister said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
