    "A teary eyed SLPP Galle District MP Geeta Kumarasinghe yesterday decried the attack on her house in which some of the awards, including some won at international forums, were destroyed by the attackers.",
    "In an impassioned speech, the Galle District MP said she had given her Swiss citizenship to serve the people of her district and had been dealt a cruel blow.",
    "\u201cI have done no wrong to anyone. As a single woman I came on this journey on my own. I had to stand on my own to get where I am here,\u201d the actor turned politician said.",
    "She had had the attackers come with swords and knives and had to hide inside her room in fear, as the mob attacked the house, she had built on the land she had inherited from her parents. \u201cI think I should bid farewell to politics. How can we carry on if this is the kind of response we get when we engage in politics? They say more women must come to politics and then women come under attack in this way,\u201d she said."
