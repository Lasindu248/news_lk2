    "Continuing its societal endeavours even during these difficult times and supporting Sri Lankans to live healthier, longer, better lives, AIA announced the renewal of its partnership with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society in 2022. This will be the fourth consecutive year that AIA will donate Rs. 100/- on behalf of every new policy sold in the year, to the Sri Lanka Cancer Society. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in this regard was signed between AIA Deputy CEO and Chief Agency Officer Upul Wijesinghe and Cancer Society Chairperson Anoja Karunaratne.",
    "Funds donated by AIA over the years are being used by the Cancer Society for the provision of care and solace to needy cancer patients as well as increasing awareness on the prevention and treatment of cancer, which is a rapidly growing concern in Sri Lanka. In fact, Non-Communicable Diseases such as Cancer continues to be a very real problem in Sri Lanka and are responsible for over 80% of deaths, which is well above the global rate of 74%.",
    "AIA\u2019s CEO Chathuri Munaweera noted, \u201d Cancer requires specialised treatment, dedicated care and a strong support system for the patients and their families and we want to continue helping the cause while appreciating the good work that the Sri Lanka Cancer Society are doing in this regard.\u201d",
