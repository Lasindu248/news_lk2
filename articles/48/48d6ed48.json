    "Local milk processing activities are underway at the Ambewela New Zealand Farm. The prices of imported milk powder have gone up beyond common man's reach with the depreciation of the rupee against dollar. The local farmers say they will not increase the prices of their products. The farm is situated in Nuwera Eliya and is adorned with lush green grass of the highest quality. The farm extends across 1,500 acres and houses over 2,000 head of cattle. World renowned dairy products such as Ambewela Fresh Milk, Ambewela Yogurt, and Ambewela Cheese are produced in these farms. Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana"
