    "Steps will be taken to look into the request made to admit students and employ teachers in the nearest school to ease their transport issues, Education Ministry secretary Prof. Kapila Perera said.",
    "He said a request was made by several teachers and principals' unions to give them the opportunity to get them appointed in the nearest schools considering the increasing transport costs and other hindrances.",
    "He said he would submit a systematic plan in the future. While addressing the media yesterday, he said that he accepted the request personally.",
    "\"Some 10,155 schools are functioning in the country. There are two schools in the country that have only two children and five teachers. 51% of the schools are primary schools with fewer than 200 students. 78% of schools have fewer than 500 students and 92% of schools have fewer than 1,000 students. 1,462 schools have fewer than 50 students. He said.",
    "There are nearly 3000 schools with fewer than 100 students. Therefore, we should sort out the issues with the children who are coming to schools, and then we can look into the transport issues with the teachers, Prof. Perera said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
