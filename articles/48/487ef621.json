    "Shattering the glass ceiling, career strategies and entering into entrepreneurship were among the focal points of a programme conducted by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently for a group of female undergraduates of the University of Colombo (UoC) in commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day.",
    "The programme was organised by Commercial Bank under the \u2018Anagi\u2019 Women\u2019s Banking initiative in collaboration with the Career Guidance Unit of the Faculty of Arts of the University. It included two panel discussions, one led by female corporate management members of Commercial Bank and the other by several leading female entrepreneurs who are also customers of the Bank.",
    "The Bank said that the programme was designed after an assessment of the need for non-financial services more than the traditional financial services offered by the Bank to this segment.",
    "In the first panel, Commercial Bank Assistant General Managers (AGMs) Personal Banking \u2013 Ms Mithila Shamini and Ms Dharshanie Perera, AGM Legal \u2013 Ms Namal Gamage, and AGM Corporate Banking \u2013 Ms Tamara Bernard shared their experiences and insights about beginning a career and climbing up the corporate ladder.",
    "Panelists of the second session were Deshabandu Dr. Thushari Koralage (Ph.D.), Founder & Principal of Asian Grammar School and Giggles International, Ms. Achala Samaradivakara, Co-founder & Managing Director of Good Market Global, Ms. Vindya Perera, Managing Director of Brilliant Cuts (Pvt) Ltd., and Ms. Niro M. Peris, Founder of Eli Products which manufactures natural local alternatives to imported food and beverages. The panelists shared their experiences and insights from their successful entrepreneurial journeys with the audience.",
    "Commenting on the programme, Commercial Bank Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer Mr S. Renganathan said: \u201cThe Bank has been focusing on supporting sustainable economic development in the country. This also means supporting the women who make up close to 35% of the labour force in Sri Lanka. We are fully aware that sustainable economic development cannot be achieved without women in the equation, and programmes like the recent one with university students are designed with this in mind.\u201d",
    "Participating students were given the opportunity to ask questions after each panel. This event which was held at the NewArts Theater of the Colombo University also saw the participation of members of the Bank\u2019s Corporate Management, including Mr Delakshan Hettiarachchi \u2013 Deputy General Manager Personal Banking and Mr S. Ganeshan \u2013 Assistant General Manager Personal Banking. The event was graced by the Vice Chancellor of the UoC, Senior Professor Chandrika N. Wijeyaratne.
