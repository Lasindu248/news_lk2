    "AFP: Crisis-struck Sri Lanka\u2019s vital tea exports have dropped to their lowest level in 23 years, official figures showed yesterday, hit by a fertiliser ban and the war in Ukraine.",
    "Tea is the island nation\u2019s biggest export commodity, bringing in about US $ 1.3 billion annually before the current economic downturn, the worst since independence in 1948.",
    "But a bungled ban on fertiliser imports last year -- introduced in a doomed effort to save foreign currency and avoid a debt default -- hit growers hard, with production falling 18 percent on-year for the period from November 2021 to February 2022.",
    "Customs data showed that first-quarter exports in 2022 correspondingly plunged to 63.7 million kilos (140 million pounds), down from 69.8 million kilos in the January-March period last year.",
    "The tally was the lowest since the first quarter of 1999, when the country shipped out 60.3 million kilos of tea.\u2019"
