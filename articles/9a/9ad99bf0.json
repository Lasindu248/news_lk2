  "body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s creditors face losing a third to half of their investment in the country\u2019s dollar bonds, after the government announced it would restructure $11 billion worth of debt, the first such financial shake-up in its modern history, according to a report issued by Reuters.",
    "\u201cFormal debt talks haven\u2019t started but analysts are already crunching the numbers to estimate what kind of haircuts could be inflicted on bondholders.\u201d",
    "\u201cMired in economic crisis, Sri Lanka has halted all external debt payments and is prioritising its remaining hard currency reserves to buy food and fuel\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe country of 22 million has been hit by nationwide street protests and shortages of everything from power to medicines, and its dollar bonds trade at deeply distressed levels of around 40 cents in the dollar.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith markets factoring in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme as part of the debt overhaul, a $1 billion bond maturing on July 25th is valued at around 45 cents to the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.\u201d",
    "\u201cMeanwhile, Citi projects that across the bonds maturing between 2022 and 2030, Sri Lanka may seek a coupon haircut of around 50%, a reduction of at least 20% in face value and maturity extensions between 10-13 years.\u201d",
    "\u201cAssuming an 11% exit yield, we estimate that the recovery value on the dollar bonds in such a scenario could range in the low to mid 40s,\u201d Citi strategist Donato Guarino said, referring to the interest rate at which the new securities will trade on the day of the debt exchange.\u201d",
    "\u201cStep-up coupons \u2013 interest payments that increase over time \u2013 could also play a role \u201cto give the government more time to recover\u201d after the restructuring, Guarino added, noting these were used in Ecuadorean and Argentine debt restructurings.\u201d",
    "\u201cTellimer analysts assumed in their base case scenario a 30% haircut. They assign a recovery value near 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds, with a 8% exit yield.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey also flagged an alternative scenario with a 42-cent recovery value and a 16% exit yield.\u201d",
    "\u201cTellimer senior economist Patrick Curran considers a 50% haircut a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario, with a recovery value as low as 30 cents for a 16% exit yield.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe highlighted the possibility that the debt overhaul might not be as swift as hoped.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhile bondholders will receive some downside protection if negotiations drag out if interest is capitalised, prolonged delays will also make for a more onerous starting point and political risk will raise exit yields, potentially eroding recovery values,\u201d they added.",
    "\u201cRatings agency S&P Global has said debt talks could be complicated and take \u201cmany months\u201d to complete.\u201d",
    "\u201cOn Wednesday, it lowered Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign currency rating to \u201cCC\u201d from \u201cCCC\u201d \u2013 two notches above the level denoting default \u2013 while Fitch cut its rating to \u201cC\u201d from \u201cCC\u201d.",
    "\u201cJPMorgan analysts say the debt servicing moratorium is expected to pave the way for an IMF programme but warn a restructuring might be \u201cmore comprehensive\u201d than what has been announced.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs of now, the debt service suspension only covers about 55% of public debt, Citi calculates, noting the latest IMF report hints at a \u201ctough programme ahead.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe fund recommends tax reforms, and possibly, curbs on public-sector wages and capital expenditure.\u201d",
    "\u201cAsset managers BlackRock and Ashmore are among the top holders of Sri Lanka\u2019s international bonds. They are part of a fledgling creditor group, with White & Case acting as legal adviser.",
    "Bondholders are in wait and see mode until the government picks a financial adviser, one creditor said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u201d Reuters report said.",
