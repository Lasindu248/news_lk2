    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Power cuts of up to 12 hours in some areas in Sri Lanka have been approved for Friday (01), Public Utilities Commission Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said as a flexible exchange regime created severe foreign exchange shortages and power deficits in the dry season.",
    "Areas A, B, C, D, E, F, P, Q, R, and S will see two hours of power outages from 4am to 6am, four hours from 8am to 12pm and six hours from 4pm to 10pm.",
    "Areas G, H, I, J, K, L, T, U, V, and W will experience two-hour power cuts from 6am to 8am, four hours from 12pm to 4pm and six hours from 6 pm to 12am.",
    "Areas M, N, O, X, Y, and Z, however, will lose power only for 5.5 hours, with a 3.5-hour interruption from 5.30am to 9am and a two-hour cut from 4pm to 6pm.",
    "Areas in the CC group will have a 3.5-hour power cut from 6am to 9am.",
    "Though the government has said the duration of the power cuts will be reduced gradually, it has been extended mainly due to lack of fuel amid severe shortage of US dollars for imports.",
    "The lack of fuel has also resulted in long queues for diesel and petrol despite record price hikes. (Colombo/Mar31/2022)"
