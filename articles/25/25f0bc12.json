    "The Alumni Association of the National Institute of Plantation Management (NIPM) held a webinar recently, to discuss the \u201cRole of the Plantation Industry to Strengthen the Sri Lanka\u2019s Economy\u201d. The vibrant and timely webinar was organized by the Association\u2019s recently appointed Committee, in line with their policy to share knowledge with members and stakeholders. Active participation was witnessed during the webinar, as the key speakers made their presentations and a lively Q&A session followed thereafter.",
    "Industry experts, Dr. Dan Seevaratnam was the key note speaker and Dr. Roshan Rajadurai, served a panellist. While Senior Prof. Aruna Kumara, from the Department of Agriculture at the University of Ruhuna, joined as an external resource person. In addition to this, Mr. Asoka Siriwardena Chairman\u2013of the National Institute of Plantation Management and Director/CEO Dr. Prasad Dharmasena, also participated in the discussion, as special invitees. The Moderator for the session was Mr. Yajith De Silva, the President of the Alumni Association of the NIPM.",
    "Speaking during the webinar, Dr. Seevaratnam stated candidly that, \u201cThe current plantation model is not viable; we can\u2019t live in the past and expect different results in the future\u201d. Discussing the tea industry, Dr. Seevaratnam added, \u201cFor decades, Sri Lanka has enjoyed a reputation for Ceylon Tea, but that is eroding fast. Thus, it\u2019s not a day too late for the industry to realize that its survival hinges on its ability to differentiate Ceylon Tea as a high-quality product. Tea factory owners should be encouraged to produce higher quality tea so that the country does not face further economic challenges.\u201d",
    "Going on to address some of the challenges faced by the sector, Dr. Seevaratnam highlighted the unavailability of foreign exchange and the fertilizer ban which, according to him, has caused the industry to take a huge hit economically, and in terms of morale and productivity. He also highlighted the need to create new export markets for Ceylon Tea and other produce, stating that huge amounts of potential remain untapped due to a lack of any concerted effort to take our produce to unpenetrated global markets.",
    "Dr. Seevaratnam poignantly pointed out that, \u201cInflation was 17% in November and 22% in December. It will keep on increasing if policymakers and relevant authorities don\u2019t take any meaningful action. We have agricultural workers and farmers who are exceptionally skilled at cultivating the land, but due to short-sighted policies, we don\u2019t have fertilizer. We also don\u2019t have agricultural chemicals, so farmers can\u2019t help to support local food production.\u201d",
