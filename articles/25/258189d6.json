    "ECONOMYNEX \u2013 The group of former government MPs who now function independently in Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament will support Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s proposal to appoint oversight committees to resolve the economic crisis, former minister Udaya Gammanpila said.",
    "\u201cWe support the decision to appoint committees. We will support it,\u201d Gammanpila said in a hurried response to a reporter\u2019s question in Colombo Monday (30) morning.",
    "In his second televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said on Sunday (29) that he is working to establish two new Committees on Monetary Affairs.",
    "\u201cWe will appoint a Legal and Methodological Committee to look into the matter.",
    "\u201cSecondly, the main problem we face is the financial condition of the banks and financial institutions. There are a number of issues that have been weakened,\u201d he said.",
    "Under Standing Order 111 of parliament, said Wickremesinghe, oversight committees can be apppointed.",
    "\u201cNo oversight committees have been appointed before. Therefore, we propose to appoint ten oversight committees. They also report to Parliament on policies. Parliament should act on that.",
    "\u201cIt should also be noted that the chairpersons of these five Finance Committees and the Ten Supervisory Committees are appointed by backbenchers. They are not appointed by Ministers.",
    "\u201cTherefore, we have the opportunity to work out a methodology that is independent of the Cabinet of Ministers and works with both the Minister and the Parliament,\u201d he said.",
    "The PM also observed that Sri Lanka\u2019s \u00a0youth are calling for a change in the existing system.",
    "\u201cThey also want to know the current issues. Therefore, I propose to appoint four youth representatives to each of these 15 committees\u00a0. One of them will be appointed by the Youth Parliament. The other three will be from the protesting groups and other activist groups. The methodology used to chose these individuals can be decided by the youth organizations themselves.",
    "\u201cIn addition, we hope to involve people with expertise in specific fields in this work. Through this work, young people will be able to learn about problems and provide solutions to them on their own. They will be able to contest elections if they wish to do so.\u201d",
    "Wickremesinghe also proposed a National Council comprising the Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the leaders of the major parties.",
    "\u201cIt should be said that the National Council is very important. The National Council can talk about the policies of the country. It can also talk about the decisions of the Cabinet. It can also talk about the reorganization of the Parliament of this country. If so, it can be called a political body.",
    "\u201cThe National Council has the right to summon the Cabinet of Ministers and the Chairmen of Committees.",
    "\u201cAccording to the new system we have proposed, the President will be held accountable to the Parliament. The Cabinet of Ministers is also accountable to Parliament. The National Council is also accountable to Parliament. Fifteen Committees and Oversight Committees are accountable to Parliament.",
    "\u201cThere is a system in place to control the Government through the Cabinet, to examine the work of the President, to oversee the work of the political affairs through the National Council and to oversee the financial affairs and other matters of the other fifteen committees. There are articles prepared on this matter. I appreciate that a number of other organizations have made similar proposals,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May30/2022)"
