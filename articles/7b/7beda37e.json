    "A shocking revelation of releasing a massive stock of harmful and substandard alcoholic beverages to the market from two liquor factories belonging to a top ruling party politician without the Government Analyst report, justifies the recent introduction of new standards for local alcohol spirits.",
    "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) last week directed the Excise Department to specify standards for liquor as soon as possible and take steps to prevent the liquor manufacturing companies from establishing a market monopoly in selling liquor by including various conditions.",
    "As a result the Department of Excise, Government Analyst Department, Sri Lanka Standard Institution, Industrial Technology Institute as well as members of the local liquor industry collaborated to introduce the new set of standards for all the alcoholic spirits in the country.",
    "However, the Daily Mirror learns that a shocking incident involving two liquor manufacturing plants belonging to a prominent ruling party politician in Kurunegala and Kalutara and the politician had been outraged by the Government Analyst Department for releasing their products without obtaining the latter\u2019s quality report.",
    "Excise Department sources on condition of anonymity told the Daily Mirror that about three weeks ago a very large stock of two local brands of arrack manufactured in these two factories in Kalutara and Kurunegala had been released to the market without obtaining the final quality approval certificate of the GA.",
    "Once the GA report was released, it had revealed that the mentioned stocks of liquor was substandard and had contained dangerous chemicals like isopropyl alcohol, which is manly used as a rubbing alcohol antiseptic commonly found in aftershave lotions, hand sanitizers and other cosmetics.",
    "An immediate directive given by the GA had then led to the mentioned two liquor companies to collect all their products of the particular batch and to be returned to the factories without even destroying them, which is highly suspicious, the Excise sources said.",
    "Presently certain Excise officials in charge of the Excise Units at these two liquor factories are \u2018under fire\u2019 by the GA and law enforcement authorities for letting these hazardous stocks out to the public.",
    "However, an impartial inquiry into the matter has also been stalled with immense pressure from the certain government officials with the involvement of the proprietor of the said companies, the sources further said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)"
