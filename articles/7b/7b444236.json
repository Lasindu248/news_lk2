    "Claiming that a mere political party could not rescue the country from the present crisis, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today it could be done only by forming a powerful people's movement and toppling this failed government.",
    "Addressing the public rally in Nugegoda organised by the National People's Power (NPP), he said this people's movement should contribute to the process of developing the country as well.",
    "He said a large number of university academics, teachers, artistes, businessmen, entrepreneurs, farmers and public and private sector employees have joined hands with the NPP.",
    "\"Everyone from top to bottom should be prepared to work towards developing the country. There should be a definite action plan for this. We should form a powerful people's movement irrespective of party, racial or religious differences,\" he said.",
    "He said NPP was in a constant discussion with industrialists and genuine entrepreneurs and that they were willing to contribute their knowledge and skills to develop this country.",
    "Dissanayake said present economic crisis was not due to a natural cause but due to failed economic policies adopted by the governments for the past 74 years.",
    "\"We are not living in a country where we need to suffer. Our country is rich of natural resources. The governments that were in power for the past 74 years destroyed national economy, domestic industries and plantations leading to this crisis,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
