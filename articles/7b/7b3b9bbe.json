    "Nurses, doctors, and hospital staff gathered outside the National Dental Hospital of Sri Lanka yesterday, to join in the country-wide protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the current Government.",
    "Commenting on their own protest, which involved all hospital staff coming together to raise placards, and posters and convey their concern, National Dental Institute Senior Consultant Dr. Gamini Navaratne said: \u201cOur country is facing a precarious situation as far as our economy is concerned. We have no gas; no petrol and people can\u2019t attend to their work on time.",
    "\u201cFor example, two of my house officers could not report to work today because they had no fuel. We are in a very dangerous situation because of the mismanagement of the economy, corruption, and theft- all three combined.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe want to tell the Government to handle these problems as soon as possible with the consultation of experts and educated people. We are forcing our politicians to give an urgent solution so people can finally return to their normal lives,\u201d Dr. Navaratne added.",
    "He commended the staff at the hospital and those who are part of the Dental Institute, for coming together in 24 hours to facilitate the gathering.",
    "\u201cWe are not divided by colour or party politics. We represent the general civil public in society,\u201d he added."
