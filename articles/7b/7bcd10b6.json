    "SJB parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva today charged that the country and the central bank is bankrupt and urged the government to, at least now, put aside political differences and come together to save the country from this bankruptcy.",
    "Delivering a strong statement in Parliament, he said that regardless whether they are in the opposition or the government as Sri Lankans they are ashamed to say it out loud, but that there is no denying the fact the country is bankrupt.",
    "The former deputy minister said he was in the diesel queue for an hour and a half yesterday but still was not able to obtain any fuel. \u201cThere\u2019s no diesel, no petrol, no milk, no gas, no medicine, and no electricity.\u201d",
    "He said that the people are fuming and that there is no minister to talk about these issues in parliament.",
    "He said that the central bank\u2019s external debt is USD 2.5 billion more than the central bank\u2019s foreign assets. \u201cThen the Central Bank has gone bankrupt.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe do not want to say this. How can we open our mouths and say that the country is bankrupt. We are also proud. We are Sri Lankans whether we are in the opposition or in the government. We were born in this country, we live in this country, and we die in this country. We have no other passport,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cAs Sri Lankans, how can we open our mouths and say that the country is bankrupt. But who made the country bankrupt? At least now, let\u2019s do something together to save this country from bankruptcy.\u201d"
