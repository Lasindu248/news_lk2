    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena on Wednesday (20) denied a statement attributed to him by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ready to step down, prompting the latter to call him a liar.",
    "Premadasa had earlier in the day told parliament that the Speaker had told a party leaders\u2019 meeting that Rajapaksa had communicated to him his willingness to resign if all party leaders representing parliament made a unanimous call for his resignation.",
    "Sri Lanka speaker conveyed to party leaders president\u2019s willingness to resign: opposition leader",
    "A war of words erupted between Abeywardena and Premadasa in parliament Wednesday afternoon when the former claimed that he had said no such thing. He had earlier remained quiet when Premadasa made his revelation about his comment.",
    "\u201cI said if someone gets 113 seats [in parliament], the president will hand over the government [to that person],\u201d said a seemingly indignant Abeywardena.",
    "To which the opposition leader responded: \u201cThat is not correct. You said in the presence of [government minister and Leader of the House] Dinesh Gunewardene.\u201d",
    "\u201cAre you saying I am lying? Honorable speaker, do not tell tom pacha (blatant lies),\u201d said Premadasa, visibly agitated.",
    "\u201cYou are not a speaker. You are a liar. Do not tell lies,\u201d retorted the opposition leader.",
    "Calls for President Rajapaksa\u2019s resignation have been growing over the past few weeks over his government\u2019s mishandling of Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis which has now precipitated a political crisis.",
    "Protests islandwide have intensified since Tuesday (19) following a fuel price hike, culminating in a killing of a civilian protestor allegedly by police. (Colombo/Apr20/2022)"
