    "Although gender equality and women empowerment are not novel concepts in the modern world, as there have been many changes occurring in the thinking patterns of the minds of people, achieving gender equality is an important part of the Sustainable Development Goals of Sri Lanka. Females play a significant role in the global economy, as they invest more on the socioeconomic life of their families more than males do.",
    "Female participation to the economy is considered a vital factor for a middle-income country like Sri Lanka to be at the forefront of the next wave of economic growth. Currently, female participation in the labour force is at 40% which is significantly lower than 75% of men\u2019s contribution. It is a known fact that, female entrepreneurs will reinvest in their business, families and education, assisting a sustainable economic growth. Therefore, empowering women is the key to achieve more entrepreneurs in the country and thereby increasing the contribution to the country\u2019s economy.",
    "The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka established a special setting for women entrepreneurs \u201cNCE Women\u2019s Wing\u201d who are already involved in exports to encourage and motivate them with a long-term vision to achieve sustainable economic growth and the achievement of development goals through active participation of women in business.
