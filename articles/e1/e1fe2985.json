    "According to the IMF, the Port City is an important opportunity for\u00a0investment promotion and for testing growth-enhancing structural reforms. However, to maximize its\u00a0benefits while minimizing associated risks, there is a need to ring-fence tax concessions, ensure\u00a0compliance with international tax and AML/CFT standards and to\u00a0shield the domestic financial\u00a0sector from offshore banking activities in the Port City.",

Under the baseline, public debt would keep increasing throughout the projection horizon, reaching 125.3 percent of GDP in 2026, and interest payments will remain above 70% of tax revenues throughout the projection horizon. The deficit generates financing needs that exceed the domestic financial system\u2019s capacity.",

    "Besides targeted support to distressed-but-viable borrowers, the CBSL should continue to closely monitor the quality of loans exiting the\u00a0moratorium. Given the financial sector risks, the CBSL should also proactively identify vulnerabilities\u00a0through stress testing while ensuring that during the process, maintaining restrictions on bank profit distributions\u00a0would help ensure capital adequacy.",
