    "All pediatricians and neonatologists in the country are in dilemma due to the absence of Endotracheal (ETT) Tubes for ventilation of new-born babies, infants and children.",
    "Sources said very soon all hospitals will run out of all their stocks of ETTs, and hospitals have arrived at a stage where they are compelled to re-use endotracheal tubes for ventilating new born babies, which is totally unacceptable.",
    "Due to the economic and political crisis in the country, medical supplies have run out in the hospital network, the source said.",
    "Therefore, doctors in hospitals are forced to change their norms of using re-usable ventilator circuits in the country.",
    "Neonatal ETTs which are in 4mm, 3.5mm, 3mm, 2.5mm, and 2mm in sizes are urgently needed.",
    "There is a national requirement of 3,500 Neonatal ETTs in sizes 3 mm and 3.5 mm, as well as 500 in size 4 mm, on an annual basis. 2,500 from 2.5mm and 500 from 2mm.\u00a0(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
