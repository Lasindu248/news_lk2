    "The meeting commenced at 11.00 a.m. today at the Transport Ministry.",
    "Lanka IOC and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), citing the significant depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar, announced record fuel price hikes earlier this week.",
    "Thereby, the bus owners called for a diesel subsidy or an increase in bus fares as a solution. They noted that the minimum bus far need to be raised to Rs. 30 and the remaining charges by 25% - 30% if a fuel subsidy is not provided.",
    "The Transport Minister stated that attention would be paid to providing a fuel subsidy without increasing bus fares.",
