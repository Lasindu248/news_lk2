    "While refusing claims that police were suppressing protests, Public Security Minister Sarath Weerasekara said today protesters were arrested following health guidelines issued by the Director General of Health Services and therefore, the blame should go to the Health DG not to the police.",
    "He told parliament that the arrests were made based on the health requirements and that it was not a political decision.",
    "He said the Health DG was issuing quarantine rules and regulations from time to time and pointed out that the new set of health guidelines were issued a few days ago, prohibiting public gatherings such as protests and meetings until further notice.",
    "The Minister said this responding to an allegation made by National Peoples' Power MP Harini Amarasuriya, who said the police arrest protesters and thereby suppress the rights of the people.",
    "\u201cThe police are only carrying out the directives made by the Health Services DG to the Police Chief. If police arrest the protesters, the blame should go to the Health DG not to the police,\u201d he said.\u00a0(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
