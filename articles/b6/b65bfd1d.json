    "\u201cFitch believes counterparty risk of SLIC\u2019s foreign-currency assets have risen following recent negative rating action on the Sri Lanka sovereign and various financial institutions.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka has an intermediate regime central bank which has been triggering currency crises with increasing frequency since the end of a civil war (2011/12, 2015/16, 2018 and 2020/22) which sent the rupee from 113 to 340 so far.",
    "Fitch said counterparty risk of SLIC\u2019s foreign-currency assets have risen following recent negative rating action on the Sri Lanka sovereign and various financial institutions.",
    "The rating agency said the heightened investment risks and earnings pressure could affect SLIC\u2019s regulatory capital profile.",

    "\u201cFitch believes the recent five-day closure of the Colombo Stock Exchange undermines the liquidity of SLIC\u2019s listed investments, especially if such closures become recurrent,\u201d",

    "Fitch Ratings \u2013 Sydney/Hong Kong \u2013 21 Apr 2022: Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited\u2019s (SLIC) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating to\u2019CC\u2019, from \u2018CCC+\u2019, and has placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).",
    "SLIC\u2019s National IFS Rating of \u2018AA(lka)\u2019 has also been placed on RWN.",
    "Fitch has also taken rating action on seven other Sri Lankan insurers; please see FitchPlaces Seven Sri Lankan Insurers on Rating Watch Negative, published 21 April 2022.",
    "The downgrade reflects the probability that ceased or interrupted payments could occur on SLIC\u2019s foreign-currency obligations due to weak foreign-currency liquidity in the localbanking system.",
    "Fitch believes counterparty risk of SLIC\u2019s foreign-currency assets have risen following recent negative rating action on the Sri Lanka sovereign and various financial institutions.",
    "The insurer has foreign-currency exposure via investments in SriLanka development bonds and deposits with local banks.",
    "The RWN is driven by heightened near-term downside risks to the insurer\u2019s credit profile,including elevated investment and liquidity risk, pressure on its regulatory capital positionand a weaker financial performance outlook.",
    "The RWN also reflects potential pressure onSLIC\u2019s foreign-currency obligations due to stretched foreign-currency liquidity in thelocal banking system and the uncertain impact from SLIC\u2019s non-insurance subsidiaries.",
    "Fitch believes the recent negative rating action on the Sri Lanka sovereign and various financial institutions underscores SLIC\u2019s investment risks, as its investment portfolio isdominated by fixed-income securities issued or guaranteed by the government.",
    "It also includes deposits and securities issued by local banks, non-bank financial institutions andcorporations; Fitch downgraded the Sri Lankan sovereign\u2019s Long-Term Foreign-CurrencyIssuer Default Rating to \u2018C\u2019, from \u2018CC\u2019, and had placed the ratings of several financialinstitutions on RWN, see Fitch Places 13 Sri Lankan Banks on Rating WatchNegative and Fitch Places Bank of Ceylon on Rating Watch Negative.",
    "Fitch assumes the Ministry of Finance\u2019s 12 April 2022 announcement that the state andpublic sector borrowers will cease all foreign-currency debt payments on borrowings thatare governed by law other than Sri Lankan law will not apply to SLIC\u2019s policyholderobligations or its subsidiaries\u2019 debt obligations.",
    "SLIC\u2019s insurance operation does not haveany debt in its capital structure. However, one of its non-insurance subsidiaries hasforeign-currency borrowings from a state-owned bank, according to the latest annualreport. It is not clear if the subsidiary will have to stop payment on these borrowings or ifthis would become SLIC\u2019s direct liability should the subsidiary be unable to pay, as theentity is ultimately owned by the state.",
    "SLIC\u2019s foreign-currency denominated insurance contract obligations tend to be small andlimited to certain non-motor classes, according to the company. The insurer, like otherdomestic insurers, relies on access to foreign-currency to make premium payments toforeign reinsurers and meet other costs that are typically sourced from overseas.",
    "SLIC\u2019s Fitch-calculated risky asset ratio (end-2020: 529%) is partly driven by the insurer\u2019slarge investment in listed and unlisted equities. Fitch believes the recent five-day closureof the Colombo Stock Exchange undermines the liquidity of SLIC\u2019s listed investments,especially if such closures become recurrent.",
    "Fitch believes the heightened investment risks and earnings pressure could affect SLIC\u2019sregulatory capital profile. A significant deterioration in the credit profiles of financialinstitutions could lead to lower regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratios, as investmentswill be subject to incremental risk charges according to local regulatory RBC rules.SLIC\u2019s Fitch Prism Model score is \u2018Somewhat Weak\u2019, based on 2020 results, and is drivenby high asset risk charges.",
    "Fitch expects the weak operating environment to affect SLIC\u2019s earnings, similarly to therest of the industry. Growth in motor insurance \u2013 the largest contributor to non-lifepremiums \u2013 is likely to remain subdued, as Fitch expects the government\u2019s ban on autoimports, imposed in 2020 to control currency depreciation, to continue. In addition,underwriting profit will be squeezed by rising motor spare-part costs due to currencydevaluation, while overall costs will climb with rising inflation. Insurers, including SLIC,also have limited ability to reprice policies, given the dent in customers\u2019 disposableincomes.",
    "SLIC, like other Sri Lankan non-life insurers, relies on international reinsurers to protectits non-motor businesses. Fitch thinks any material changes to reinsurance structures uponrenewal due to rising reinsurance costs could undermine the insurer\u2019s risk managementpractices and ability to write new business.",
    "Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:",
    "Fitch expects to resolve the RWN in the next six months once the impact on the insurer\u2019scredit profile becomes more apparent. Fitch also seeks greater clarity on the government\u2019srestrictions on servicing foreign-currency obligations, including the impact on SLIC\u2019spolicyholder obligations and the debt obligations of its non-insurance subsidiaries.",
