    "The gas distribution system in the country came to a standstill due to unavailability of fuel to handle transportation and dearth of dollars to procure gas, the main gas distribution companies said.",
    "They said this following yesterday's withdrawal of service by the Petroleum Private Tanker Owners\u2019 Association, the whole gas distribution network in the country ground to a halt.",
    "They said the current dollar crunch also affected the country's gas imports.",
    "They said the reason for this situation is the inability to release the two gas ships that had sailed into the country two weeks ago and had engaged in discussions with the authorities for a fortnight in order to obtain dollars for this purpose.\u00a0(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
