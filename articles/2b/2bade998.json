    "Canon\u2019s EOS System made its debut in March 1987 with the launch of the EOS 650 single-lens reflex (SLR) camera and EF lenses. An acronym of \u201cElectro Optical System\u201d while also carrying the name of the Greek Goddess of the dawn, the EOS series saw first light in 1987 as the world\u2019s first fully electronic mount system, representing a new generation of AF SLR cameras. During the film-camera era, EOS SLR cameras garnered high acclaim from a wide range of users for their innovative technologies and designs focused on Canon\u2019s key concepts of high speed and ease of use. During this period, the company launched the top-of-the-line professional model EOS-1 in 1989 and, with the introduction of the compact lightweight EOS Kiss (EOS Rebel XS and EOS 500 in other regions) in 1993, succeeded in expanding its user base.",
