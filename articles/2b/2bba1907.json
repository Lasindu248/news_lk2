    "Participants of the 100 Voices project at the Galle Face Green",
    "Symbolizing the heart of people\u2019s protests and popular movements, the lyrics of \u2018Do You Hear the People Sing?\u2019 from the celebrated musical and movie \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 echoed across the Galle Face Green on Saturday evening. \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 encapsulates much of the spirit of French history in the late 1700s and 1800s \u2013 a volatile period of French history that saw repeated uprisings against an oppressive government, rampant class divide and social instability. Over a 100 choristers joined in solidarity to sing and perform for the same cause \u2013 end corruption, bankruptcy and nepotism.",
    "The main objective of the 100 Voices project was to remind the rulers that artistes, choristers and performers also stand against corruption and to let their voices be heard. It was also a reminder to the rest of the country that people need to overcome this crisis together as one nation.",
    "\u201cThis happened over a matter of two days and I\u2019m amazed by the response we have had,\u201d said veteran theatre practitioner and Artistic Director of The Workshop Players, Jerome De Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how we got a lot of people coming. For instance one of my students from Negombo and their families have come. In fact, they have come from all over. We haven\u2019t met for over two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and it was amazing how all these people came in such short notice and joined together to sing the revolutionary anthem of freedom by \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019. It was also beautiful that we had a trilingual message that came through to all people out there. To show them that they shouldn\u2019t think of us as elitist as we are one with you. For you to join us and fight to break through the barricades and wave that flag of freedom. As artistes we came through together because as artistes we are the most neglected lot of people by the state or anyone. So this is us coming together in solidarity for the same cause, freedom from corruption, bankruptcy and looking forward as a united force of people of all ages from the very little to the oldest. We are getting together to fight for a cause for the future of everyone,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSo this is us coming together in solidarity for the same cause, freedom from corruption, bankruptcy and looking forward as a united force of people of all ages from the very little to the oldest\u201d,\u00a0 said Jerome De Silva, veteran theatre practitioner and Artistic Director of The Workshop Players\"",
    "Speaking about the significance of the song at this juncture, De Silva said that it talks about the barricades, not just physical barricades but barricades of us trying to break through this nepotism. \u201cIt was the song of the student revolution in 1815 in France. Even though they all died at the barricades still they fought for a reason. We don\u2019t mind giving up our lives for the struggle of the future generations,\u201d he underscored.",
    "For Kevin Cruze, actor, thespian and founder of Cold Theatre 7 and many other artistes, the Easter Sunday attacks, COVID-19 pandemic and the prevailing situation in the country has done more harm than good in terms of their passion. \u201cFrom an artiste\u2019s point of view, it hasn\u2019t been easy for us. I\u2019ve been having it rough since Easter Sunday attacks. Then COVID hit us and now this crisis. The theatres are open but we have other issues in the country that we have to fight for. Therefore we have to come together in whatever way possible; as artistes, performers and musicians and say that we are also in this with the people. We want to fight corruption and make sure that people in charge hear us. That\u2019s why we thought of doing this for the entire community. To show the power of people and artistes that we are standing against corruption as well. We sang the national anthem because I wanted to remind everyone here as we are all in it together as one nation, one family and one body to fight corruption. We also brought in a Tamil artiste to sing songs in Tamil to connect with that community as well.\u201d",
    "\"The main reason why we came here is that as artistes we have been going through a rough patch. We were slowly recovering from this period when politicians created this mess,\u201d said Mithun Jayalath\"",
    "At a parallel venue at the now infamous \u2018GotaGoGama\u2019 another group of professional dancers, percussionists and musicians had set the ground to perform the \u201918 sanniya\u2019. This is a traditional Sinhalese exorcism ritual that consists of 18 dances, each depicting a particular illness or ailment affecting humans. But this time, the ritual was performed to heal Sri Lanka, the patient. Around 50 percussionists, dancers and musicians gathered at \u2018GotaGoGama\u2019 who commenced their performances with a variety of percussion rhythms that kept protesters\u2019 toes tapping.",
    "\u201cWe came here for artistes who have been affected by this crisis and to invoke blessings on people who are continuing this struggle,\u201d said Mithun Jayalath, the leader of the group. \u201cThe main reason why we came here is that as artistes we have been going through a rough patch. We were slowly recovering from this period when politicians created this mess. We want to ensure that a more proactive set of people get elected to power so that all people would benefit. All these performers have come here to contribute to this struggle with their expertise, which is art. We planned to do a puja to invoke blessings on the people.\u201d",
    "\u201d We have to come together in whatever way possible; as artistes, performers and musicians and say that we are also in this with the people,\u201d commented Kevin Cruze, actor, thespian and founder of Cold Theatre 7\"",
    "Speaking about the role of art in a revolution, Jayalath said that since the past percussion instruments played a major role during people\u2019s revolutions. \u201cDuring times of war, the main character is a percussionist. His beat and mood set the stage for a war, a peaceful settlement etc. We wanted to include a percussion performance due to this reason.\u201d",
    "\u201cSri Lanka has a rich culture and heritage but due to the political system, the culture is being disconnected from its people. Our culture should be our priority. These performances known as \u2018Seth Shanthi\u2019 be it a Devol Maduwa, Gammaduwa, Kohomba Kankariya, are rituals that invoke blessings on the country and on people who join the protests. We are doing this to protect the people of our country and these aren\u2019t any sort of rituals that would"
