    "Police officers who were at Poluwa junction near the parliamentary complex should not have assaulted the army officers who approached the area by motor cycles on Tuesday, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka told Parliament today.",
    "\u201cI would have even opposed the army officers if they assaulted police officers,\u201d Field Marshal Fonseka said.",
    "\u201cAt the same time I would like to say that Army officers should not have come in motor bikes without number plates. I don\u2019t know whether these officers were sent \u00a0by someone but anyway their arrival in the scene cannot be justified,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
