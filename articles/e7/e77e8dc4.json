    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lankan Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has expressed concern over the draft bill for the 21st Amendment to the constitution, proposed by Justice Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC.",
    "Sajith Premadasa said that MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the General Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balavegaya presented a bill titled the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, which seeks to abolish the Executive Powers of the President and restore the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.",
    "He said the President in his address to the nation on the 11th of May 2022, committed that the 20th Amendment to the constitution would be repealed and the 19th Amendment to the constitution would be restored and steps would be taken to abolish the executive presidency.",
    "However, the Opposition Leader noted that contrary to the promises given by the President, the draft by the Justice Minister enables the President to hold ministerial portfolios, which was not envisaged in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.",
    "He noted that the draft bill instead of reducing the power of the executive president does the opposite by strengthening the President\u2019s executive powers contrary to the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.",
