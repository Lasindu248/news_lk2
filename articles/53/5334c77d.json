  "title": "Sri Lanka open to buying Russian oil, accepting China\u2019s financial help - PM",
  "body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka may be compelled to buy more oil from Russia as the island nation hunts desperately for fuel amid an unprecedented economic crisis, the newly appointed prime minister said.",
    "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would first look to other sources, but would be open to buying more crude from Moscow. Western nations largely have cut off energy imports from Russia in line with sanctions over its war on Ukraine.",
    "In a wide-ranging interview with Associated Press on Saturday, Wickremesinghe also indicated he would be willing to accept more financial help from China, despite his country\u2019s mounting debt. And while he acknowledged that Sri Lanka\u2019s current predicament is of \u201cits own making,\u201d he said the war in Ukraine is making it even worse \u2013 and that dire food shortages could continue until 2024. He said Russia had also offered wheat to Sri Lanka.",
    "Wickremesinghe, who is also Sri Lanka\u2019s finance minister, spoke to the AP in his office in the capital, Colombo, one day shy of a month after he took over for a sixth time as prime minister.",
    "Appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resolve an economic crisis that has nearly emptied the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, Wickremesinghe was sworn in after days of violent protests last month forced his predecessor, Rajapaksa\u2019s brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, to step down and seek safety from angry crowds at a naval base.",
    "Sri Lanka has amassed US$51 billion in foreign debt, but has suspended repayment of nearly US$7 billion due this year. The crushing debt has left the country with no money for basic imports, which means citizens are struggling to access basic necessities such as food, fuel, medicine \u2013 even toilet paper and matches. The shortages have spawned rolling power outages, and people have been forced to wait days for cooking gas and gasoline in lines that stretch for kilometres.",
    "Two weeks ago, the country bought a 90,000-metric-ton (99,000-ton) shipment of Russian crude to restart its only refinery, the energy minister told reporters.",
    "Wickremesinghe did not comment directly on those reports, and said he did not know whether more orders were in the pipeline. But he said Sri Lanka desperately needs fuel, and is currently trying to get oil and coal from the country\u2019s traditional suppliers in the Middle East.",
    "\u201cIf we can get from any other sources, we will get from there. Otherwise [we] may have to go to Russia again,\u201d he said.",
    "Officials are negotiating with private suppliers, but Wickremesinghe said one issue they face is that \u201cthere is a lot of oil going around which can be sourced back informally to Iran or to Russia.\u201d",
    "\u201cSometimes we may not know what oil we are buying,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly we are looking at the Gulf as our main supply.\u201d",
    "Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February, global oil prices have skyrocketed. While Washington and its allies are trying to cut financial flows supporting Moscow\u2019s war effort, Russia is offering its crude at a steep discount, making it extremely enticing to a number of countries.",
    "Like some other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has remained neutral on the war in Europe.",
    "Sri Lanka has received and continues to reach out to numerous countries for help \u2013 including the most controversial, China, currently the country\u2019s third-largest creditor. Opposition figures have accused the president and the former prime minister of taking on a slew of Chinese loans for splashy infrastructure projects that have since failed to generate profit, instead adding to the country\u2019s debt.",
    "Critics have also pointed to a beleaguered port in the hometown of then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Hambantota, built along with a nearby airport as part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative projects, saying they cost too much and do too little for the economy.",
    "\u201cWe need to identify what are the projects that we need for economic recovery and take loans for those projects, whether it be from China or from others,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where do we deploy the resources?\u201d",
    "The prime minister said his government has been talking with China about restructuring its debts. Beijing had earlier offered to lend the country more money but balked at cutting the debt, possibly out of concern that other borrowers would demand the same relief.",
    "\u201cChina has agreed to come in with the other countries to give relief to Sri Lanka, which is a first step,\u201d Wickremesinghe said. \u201cThis means they all have to agree [on] how the cuts are to take place and in what manner they should take place.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is also seeking financial help from the World Food Programme, which may send a team to the country soon, and Wickremesinghe is banking on a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. But even if approved, he does not expect to see money from the package until October onwards.",
    "Wickremesinghe acknowledged that the crisis in Sri Lanka has been of its \u201cown making.\u201d Many have blamed government mismanagement, deep tax cuts in 2019, policy blunders that devastated crops and a sharp plunge in tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic. But he also stressed that the war in Ukraine, which has thrown global supply chains into a tailspin and pushed fuel and food prices to unaffordable levels, has made things much worse.",
    "\u201cThe Ukraine crisis has impacted our \u2026 economic contraction,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks the economy will shrink even further before the country can begin to recoup and rebuild next year.",
    "\u201cI think by the end of the year, you could see the impact in other countries\u201d as well, he said. \u201cThere is a global shortage of food. Countries are not exporting food.\u201d",
    "In Sri Lanka, the price of vegetables has jumped threefold while the country\u2019s rice cultivation is down by about a third, the prime minister said.",
    "The shortages have affected both the poor and the middle classes, triggering months of protests. Mothers are struggling to get milk to feed their babies, as fears of a looming hunger crisis grow.",
    "Wickremesinghe said he felt terrible watching his nation suffer, \u201cboth as a citizen and a prime minister.\u201d",
    "He said he has not ever seen anything like this in Sri Lanka \u2013 and did not think he ever would. \u201cI have generally been in governments where I ensured people had three meals and their income increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had difficult times. \u2026 But not like this. I have not seen \u2026 people without fuel, without food.\u201d"
