  "body_lines": [
    "Stating that he had received an invitation to join the new government, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB) MP Mayantha Dissanayake today said he would use it an opportunity to work for the nation.",
    "MP Dissanayake came out with this remark when he was questioned whether he would join the government at a media briefing last morning.",
    "I have received an invitation to join the government. However I am not willing to leave SJB, but would work for the nation if I get an opportunity. I am also not willing to move away from the party line,\" Mr. Dissanayake said.",
    "\"There is a possibility of an improvement, though the nation is faced with a severe economic crisis,\" he added.",
    "\"The decision by the donor agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to allow Sri Lanka to use assistance granted by them to purchase essential goods is a positive move. Incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had done his best in this regard,\" he also said.",
    "MP Rajitha Senaratne who also participated in the briefing said the present government should be toppled, as it is not a proper interim government.\" It is clear that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is controlling Parliament when one considers the sudden decision to nominate MP Ajith Rajapaksa for the deputy speaker's post amidst a consensus reached by all parties to appoint a female candidate for that slot. This shows that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has no control over these,\" he said. (Yohan Perera)"
