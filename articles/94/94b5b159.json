  "body_lines": [
    "Due to a shortage of diesel, the All Island School Van Operators' Association (AISVOA) yesterday said that they are unable to continue with their service.",
    "They said most of the school vans had to stop running because they were not able to get sufficient diesel.",
    "\"We have to languish in diesel queues from morning or from the previous evening to get fuel to run the service. Though we are facing the current economic crisis, the leasing and loan settlements have to be paid on time,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, the government should take action to minimise our burden by providing sufficient fuel to run the service. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
