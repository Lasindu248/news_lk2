    "Envoys of the United States and several other key nations in the west, as well as Japan on Friday, called on Sri Lanka to join in active support against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
    "In a joint statement, the ambassadors and high commissioners to Sri Lanka urged the island nation to raise \u201cvocal support\u201d for Ukraine, international law, including the United Nations charter.",
    "\u201cWe urge Sri Lanka to join us in calling on Russia to end it hostilities immediately.\u201d",
    "The statement was issued by the head of the delegation of the European Union, high commissioners of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the ambassadors of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Rumania, Switzerland and the United States.",
    "\u201cWe will work together with our friends and allies around the world to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored. We stand with Ukraine; and for freedom, democracy, and the sovereignty of nations around the world,\u201d the envoys said.",
    "The envoys condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as an unprovoked, unjust and illegal attack on a peaceful, democratic and sovereign state. \u201cThis outrageous attack is a gross violation of international law, including the UN charter.\u201d",
    "The statement slammed Russia for dramatically escalating its attacks on civilian neighbourhoods and infrastructure, leading to large numbers of civilian casualties. Millions of ordinary civilians - mainly women, children and older persons - have been forced to flee from their homes into neighbouring countries as refugees, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the last 70 years, it read further.",
    "Russia threatens the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that underpin peace and security around the world, the representatives to Sri Lanka stressed.",
    "The statement also read: \u201cWe stand united in condemnation of the Russian government\u2019s attacks on Ukraine.\u00a0 In the UN General Assembly on 2 March, 141 countries \u2013 an overwhelming majority \u2013 voted to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion.\u00a0 This demonstrates Russia\u2019s utmost isolation from the international community.\u00a0 Countries supporting Ukraine have imposed an unprecedented package of targeted sanctions to inflict heavy cost on Russia.\u00a0 These aim to degrade Russia\u2019s capacity to pursue its attacks against Ukraine, and to press Russia to withdraw from hostilities.\u00a0 We have seen organisations from banks to oil companies, to football leagues, make it clear that Putin\u2019s actions have consequences and his regime can no longer be part of the international community.\u201d",
    "It said the friends and allies of Ukraine have committed significant levels of economic and humanitarian assistance with many countries opening their boarders to Ukrainian families fleeing the war.",
    "The envoys also accused Russia of promoting false narratives as a pretext for invasion.",
    "\u201cThe Russian government has conducted an aggressive disinformation campaign against Ukraine in a spurious attempt to justify its invasion. There is no justification for Russia\u2019s campaign to subvert its democratic neighbours. Russia falsely accuses NATO of provocation. NATO is, and always has been, a defensive alliance, and poses no threat to Russia.\u201d"
