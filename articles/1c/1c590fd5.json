  "body_lines": [
    "Fitch Ratings has placed the National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings of seven Sri Lankan insurers on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The insurers are:",
    "-National Insurance Trust Fund Board, HNB Assurance PLC, HNB General Insurance Limited, People\u2019s Insurance PLC, Continental Insurance Lanka Limited",
    "Co-operative Insurance Company Limited and Sanasa General Insurance Company Limited.",
    "Fitch has also taken rating action on Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka Insurance Corp\u2019s IFS to \u2018CC\u2019; placed IFS, \u2018AA(lka)\u2019 National IFS on RWN.",
    "The RWN is driven by heightened near-term downside risks to the insurers\u2019 credit",
    "profiles, including elevated investment and liquidity risks, pressure on regulatory capital positions and a weaker financial performance outlook. The RWN also reflects potential pressure on foreign-currency obligations for some companies due to the stretched foreign- currency liquidity in the local banking system.",
    "Fitch believes recent negative rating action on the Sri Lanka sovereign and on various financial institutions underscores the investment risks of domestic insurers, whose investment portfolios are dominated by fixed-income securities issued or guaranteed by the government, deposits and securities issued by local banks, non-bank financial institutions and corporations; Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign rating to \u2018C\u2019, from \u2018CC\u2019 and had placed the ratings of several financial institutions on RWN.",
    "Fitch believes the heightened investment risks and earnings pressure could affect insurers\u2019 regulatory capital profiles. A significant deterioration in the credit profiles of financial institutions could lead to lower regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratios, as investments will be subject to incremental risk charges according to local regulatory RBC rules.",
    "We think the weak foreign-currency liquidity in the local banking system could limit insurers\u2019 ability to meet foreign-currency obligations. This includes premium payments to foreign reinsurers and other costs that are typically sourced from overseas. Foreign-currency denominated insurance contract obligations vary by insurer, but tend to be small and limited to certain non-motor classes.",
    "Fitch-rated insurers do not have any local- or foreign-currency denominated debt in their capital structures. Fitch expects the weak operating environment to affect insurers\u2019 earnings. Growth in motor insurance \u2013 the largest contributor to non-life premiums for most insurers \u2013 is likely to remain subdued, as Fitch expects the government\u2019s ban on auto imports, imposed in 2020 to control currency depreciation, to continue. In addition, underwriting profits will be squeezed by rising motor spare-part costs due to currency devaluation, while overall costs will climb with rising inflation. Insurers also have limited ability to reprice policies, given the dent in customers\u2019 disposable incomes.",
    "Sri Lankan non-life insurers rely on international reinsurers to mitigate risks in their non-motor businesses. Fitch thinks any material changes to reinsurance structures upon renewal amid rising reinsurance costs could undermine insurers\u2019 risk management practices and ability write new business.",
