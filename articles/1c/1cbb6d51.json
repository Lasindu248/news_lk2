    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka\u2019s Stage and television actor Jehan Appuhami completed his three-day trek to the president\u2019s offices carrying a life-sized cross on his shoulder, demanding justice for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.",
    "Appuhami carried a life-sized cross from Katuwapitiya to Galle Face, landing at the heart of an ongoing, weeks-long protest demanding President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his administration resign for failing to properly manage the economy.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst economic crisis in its history. The island nation is in short supply of medicine, fuel, and other basic necessities, resulting in hospitals delaying surgeries, massive lines at gas stations, and the government defaulting on all its loans to use the money to buy food instead.",
