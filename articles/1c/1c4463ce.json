Ceylinco Life has been ranked the 28th most valuable brand overall among the 100 most valuable brands in the country, which include the largest banks, telcos and retail giants.",
    "Notably, Ceylinco Life has also advanced from the \u2018AA\u2019 Brand Rating it received last year from Brand Finance, to an \u2018AA+\u2019 Brand Rating this year which denotes its very low credit risk and strong ability to meet financial obligations.",
    "Commenting on this latest affirmation of the value and strength of the Ceylinco Life brand, the Company\u2019s Managing Director/CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said: \u201cAs a company whose mission is to de-risk the future of millions of lives, our success lies in the trust and confidence that Sri Lankans have placed on us. To be consistently ranked as the leading and most valuable life insurance brand is invaluable, not only because it reassures our customers but also because it reaffirms our ability to weather even the most debilitating economic and social challenges, such as those witnessed in recent times.\u201d",
    "Referring to the life insurance industry in the country, Brand Finance observed that life insurance brands grew at a faster rate than general insurance brands, with total brand value increasing by 9 per cent in 2022 in contrast to the 1 per cent recorded by general insurance brands. \u201cThe sector has shown a promising uptick in growth of premiums, with demand further increasing as consumers see the need for critical life protection after the outbreak of the virus,\u201d Brand Finance reported.",
