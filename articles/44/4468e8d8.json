    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s new government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe should respect the independence of the central bank, and any interference would jeopardise the country\u2019s rescue efforts, top economist W A Wijewardene said.",
    "Wickremesinghe\u2019s statement that a billion rupees would be printed to pay salaries had triggered widespread concern, he said.",
    "\u201cIt is like giving a sugar meal to a diabetic,\u201d Wijewardena told a forum organized by Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank.",
    "However there had been immediate pushback from independent economists, he said.",
    "The quick tax measures announced by the Prime Minister this week, while not giving very much revenue immediately would bring confidence, he said.",
    "Wijewardene said interference in the central bank\u2019s indpendence could jeopardise the current efforts to stabilize the economy."
