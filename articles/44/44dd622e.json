    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) would be the only commission with the authority to issue the final decision on issuing licences to any unsolicited agreement made with the government presented by companies.",
    "Addressing the media, PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said they can agree with the demands made by the unions up to 60%, but the final decision on issuing the licence for establishing the 500MW wind power project in Mannar and Pooneryn will be taken by the PUCSL.",
    "\"Companies can sign agreements with the government while bringing unsolicited bids.\" But the final decision on issuing licences will be taken by the PUCSL. Accordingly, if we are unable afford the agreements, and which are illegal, we will never give permission.",
    "Ratnayake said, \"We have the authority to refuse projects that are not suitable for long-term power generation and are not supported by the most cost-effective plan in the country,\" he said.",
    "On Wednesday (8) night, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers\u2019 Union (CEBEU) had launched a countrywide strike over the amendment to the Electricity Act, which would wide open the path for Adani Group\u2019s proposal for the 500 MW Wind Power Project in Mannar and Pooneryn to materialize without following the due process.
