    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Justifying brutal way of controlling a protest, Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Public Security Prasanna Ranatunga said on Wednesday (20) the police shooting and killing of a protester in the island nation\u2019s central town of Rambukkana saved over 300 lives.",
    "A protester was shot dead in a clash when a protest turned into violence in Rambukkana on Tuesday. Another 24 have been injured with two are treated for critical injuries, hospital sources have said. The protest was staged by thousands of local area people against fuel shortage and price hike.",
    "Police have said they used \u201cminimum force\u201d to control the protest and they had to resort to such tough action when protesters attempted to set fire a bowser with over 30,000 litres of fuel, forcefully stopped across the main railway crossing.",
    "Many opposition legislators asked Ranatunga to resign as he failed in his duty as the minister in charge of police.",
    "\u201cI must say if the police didn\u2019t take that action, 300 -400 would have been killed by now,\u201d he told the parliament referring to the blast of the fuel bowser.",
    "\u201cIf that had happened, these people would ask me why I stayed until such disaster happened.\u201d",
    "The minister\u2019s comments came as Sri Lanka\u2019s international partners including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway as well as the United Nations and global rights groups have raised concerns over the violence and asked for an impartial and independent investigation.
