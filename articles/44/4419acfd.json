    "Head of 43rd Brigade MP Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said he will take up responsibility in the government if the government should be converted into a real multi party interim government with a road map to deliver the nation from the current crisis.",
    "MP Ranawaka told a media conference that there are few steps which the government should take to ensure that it is converted into a real multi party interim government.",
    "He therefore suggested establishing oversight committees which will monitor the miniseries and include all 224 members of Parliament and a special council of formulating policies comprising all parties in Parliament. He then called for the appointment of government offices and converting police into an Independent body.",
    "\u201cThere are some state officers who work for their own agenda rather than focusing on national interest. IGP and SSP Deshabandu Tennakoon in particular have politicized the police. Therefore we call for the removal of the IGP and appoint new SSP and OICs. In addition Ministers who have been already appointed should be made to work for political and economic reforms. Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe should now bring in the 32 amendment and present it to Parliament by next week itself,\u201d the MP said,",
    "\u201cWe will take up responsibilities in the government if these conditions are fulfilled,\u201d he added.(Yohan Perera)"
