    "In a joint statement, Unilever Sri Lanka Marketing Director \u2013 Homecare, Foods & Refreshments and Water Sharmila Bandara, and Customer Development Director Aruna Mawilmada said, \u201cThe Out-Of-Home food and beverage industry has always been and continues to be a thriving opportunity in Sri Lanka, owing to the copious number of consumption occasions that have risen over the years with the opening of new food and beverage outlets in the country. The past few months have also seen a boom in tourism and new trends that have created many more oppor-tunities in the food service sector for hotels, restaurants, fast-food establishments and caf\u00e9s alike, making this merger timely and imperative for the growth and success of our UFS busi-ness.\u201d",

With the synergies we enjoy as one busi-ness, to our global and local expertise and future-fit capabilities in Sales and Supply Chain, I am confident that we can reimagine our place in the \u2018Foods & Refreshment\u2019 and \u2018Food Solutions\u2019 markets, future-proofing our portfolio at Unilever Sri Lanka.\u201d"
