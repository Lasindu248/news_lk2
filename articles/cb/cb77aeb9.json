    "Kim added that North Korea will \u201covercome the current sudden situation and win victory in the emergency epidemic prevention work\u201d.",
    "It was unclear from the KCNA report how many Covid infections had been detected.",
    "North Korea\u2019s crumbling health infrastructure would struggle to deal with a major outbreak, with its 25 million people not believed to be vaccinated, experts say.",
    "\u201cFor Pyongyang to publicly admit omicron cases, the public health situation must be serious,\u201d Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul said.",
    "\u201cPyongyang will likely double down on lockdowns, even though the failure of China\u2019s zero-Covid strategy suggests that approach won\u2019t work against the Omicron variant.\u201d",
    "North Korea has turned down offers of vaccinations from the World Health Organization, and China and Russia.",

    "North Korea is surrounded by countries that have battled -- or are still fighting to control -- significant outbreaks of Omicron.",
    "South Korea, which has high rates of vaccination, has recently eased almost all Covid-19 restrictions, with cases sharply down after an Omicron-fuelled spike in March.",
    "Neighbouring China, the world\u2019s only major economy to still maintain a zero-Covid policy, is battling multiple Omicron outbreaks.",
    "Major Chinese cities, including the financial capital Shanghai, have been under strict lockdowns for weeks.",
    "It appears North Korea will try to avoid China\u2019s extreme measures like \u201cvirtually imprisoning residents in apartments\u201d, said Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute.",
    "But even more limited lockdowns would create a \u201csevere food shortage and the same chaos China is now facing,\u201d he said.",
    "Seoul-based specialist site NK News reported that areas of Pyongyang had already been locked down for two days, with reports of panic buying.",
    "The public emergence of Covid in Pyongyang could also have repercussions on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme.",
    "South Korea\u2019s hawkish new President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was sworn in Tuesday, has vowed to get tough with Pyongyang, after five years of failed diplomacy.",
    "After high-profile talks collapsed in 2019, North Korea has doubled-down on weapons testing, conducting a blitz of launches so far this year, including intercontinental ballistic missiles.",
    "Satellite imagery indicates North Korea is preparing to conduct a nuclear test, and the United States has warned this could come as soon as this month.",
    "But the Covid-19 outbreak could potentially disrupt their military program, analysts said.",
    "\u201cThere is a possibility of delaying the nuclear test in order to focus on overcoming the coronavirus,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told AFP.",
    "But he said if public fears over an outbreak were to spread, Kim might go ahead with a test \u201cto divert this fear to another place\u201d."
