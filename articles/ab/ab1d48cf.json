    "Incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will have to resign from his post or will have to dance according to the tune of SLPP if he remains, an SJB MP said yesterday.",
    "SJB MP Mujibur Rahman told a media briefing yesterday that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will have to bow down to SLPP if he wants to remain as the premier.",
    "\u201cThe present government cannot be called a multi-party government, as it is controlled by SLPP. Ministers of the new cabinet are ones who have contested under the SLPP ticket other than the two from SJB,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cReducing the power of the Executive President is in the balance as questions have been raised on the 21st amendment, which was presented to cabinet on Monday. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has claimed that there are no provisions to reduce powers of the President in the 21st Amendment. On the other hand, preventing those with dual citizenship from coming to Parliament is also in the balance,\u201d he also said.",
    "Asked about the claims made by Ministers Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara that they are still members of SJB, Mr. Rahman said these are remarks that the two ministers say to comfort themselves. \u201cSJB will take disciplinary action against the two Ministers soon,\u201d he said.
