    "As the year came to a close, Hambantota International Port\u2019s (HIP) corporate social initiative shifted their focus on macro issues to look at their immediate neighbourhood, to see where they could be of service to the community. Two initiatives were put in place by the Human Resources Division that coordinates the port\u2019s sustainability projects.",
    "HIP co-sponsored and participated in a beach cleanup close to the port. This sustainability initiative was part of a larger programme by the Marine Environment Protection Authority \u2013 Sri Lanka (MEPA), in line with the concept of \u201cSayura Surakina Ralla,\u201d and was conducted within the Hambantota District under the mentorship of the State Ministry of Coast Conservation & Low-Lying Lands Development.\u00a0 Around 7,500 kilograms of waste was removed from the beach in the district and had nearly a thousand people participating.",
    "The port also gave dry rations and other essential items to the \u201cSarana Blind Elders Home\u201d that provides shelter to 28 visually impaired inmates who were in need.",
    "\u201cUnder the vision of our CEO, this year we focus on macro projects like the human-elephant conflict and partnering state agencies to actively engage in sustainable solutions like the \u201cHope Village\u201d project, to assist villagers develop their livelihoods under a cooperative model and helping to develop the region\u2019s healthcare facilities for example funding the Hambantota district\u2019s PCR testing laboratory.\u00a0 We also strongly feel it is our responsibility to look at other prevalent issues of social concern like cleaning the beaches to reduce environmental and marine pollution around us and helping the community in need.\u00a0 This is a part of our systemic approach to sustainable engagement with the natural and social environment around us in both macro and micro levels. This elder\u2019s home is not far from the port premises, and it was our decision this time to look into their needs before the new year,\u201d said Jeevan Premasara, Senior General Manager, Human Resources and Administration Department.",
