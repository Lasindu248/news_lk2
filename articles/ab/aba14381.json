  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which has been forced to borrow dollars by authorities whenever money is printed to create forex shortages has lost at least 250 billion rupees over three weeks as the rupee fell, based on available data.",
    "The CPC had taken dollar debt and suppliers\u2019 credit totalling 3,356 million dollars sacked Petroleum Minister Udaya Gammanpila told parliament in January.",
    "The CPC had repaid 611 million worth of debt but banks had been unable to buy dollars due to forex shortages, he said.",
    "As a result by the last week of January, the CPC owed state banks a minimum of 2.745 billion US dollars.",
    "The CPC is made to borrow dollars by authorities due to a widespread Mercantilist belief held in the island that balance of payments troubles are caused not by central bank liquidity injections in a pegged regime, but due to imports \u2013 mainly oil \u2013 and a current account deficit.",
    "Shock revelation on how Sri Lanka\u2019s CPC ended up with billions of dollar debt",
    "Nick Leeson-style losses at Sri Lanka\u2019s CPC raise big questions: Bellwether",
    "The CPC has no rupee revenues but authorities usually blocked the agency from buying dollars in the open market as liquidity injections hit made to keep the policy rate, hitting the island\u2019s non-credible reserve collecting peg now called a \u2018flexible exchange rate\u2019.",
    "A flexible exchange rate is neither a free-floating regime with an inflation target (domestic anchor) nor a consistent peg at a fixed rate (external anchor).",
    "The peg was allowed to fall on March 08, after two years of monetary printing depleted foreign reserves.",
    "By March 29, the indicative spot dollar rate had weakened to 294.98 rupees.",
    "Based on the rate, the CPC now had an unrealized loss of at least 259 billion rupees, based on a 2.74 billion dollar debt.",
    "Unlike loans taken for capital expansion, such as a pipeline that would bring future revenues and potentially be repaid with higher rupee revenues, the dollar debt has been mostly used for consumption and to fund losses of goods already sold.",
    "The CPC is made to borrow every year by the central bank that follows an inflationary policy. The loans are repaid when the deflationary policy is followed and reserves are re-built when domestic credits fall.",
    "In the same manner, as the CPC, the central government also borrowed through International Sovereign Bonds to repay maturing debt as money was printed, instead of squeezing the current account, analysts have shown.",
    "Suppliers\u2019 credits are usually used by state economists to fund losses and off-budget subsidies.",
    "They then complain that there is an external current account deficit.",
    "But in 2018, the then Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera introduced a market-priced fuel formula amid heavy opposition from the then opposition Sri Lanka Padujana Party but the central bank leadership printed money as domestic credit recovered and busted the rupee from 151 to 182 to the US dollar.",
    "The CPC then kept its rupee revenues in repo transactions, allowing the money in state banks to be loaned out and bring more imports, completely sabotaging the price hikes which were supposed to reduce the disposable income of fuel users and reduce non-oil imports.",
    "If the state banks were unable to buy dollars with the rupee paid and the CPC\u2019s liability is considered to have been settled, the bank or banks concerned would have a 611 million dollars negative net open position. It is not considered to have been settled,",
    "However in Sri Lanka usually politicians are blamed for the country\u2019s economic ills. When money is printed and inflation rises, people also demand subsidies.",
    "With the rupee falling, calls are intensifying to set up a currency board or a credible peg where state economists will no longer be able to print money, trigger external collapses and foment social unrest.",
    "In 2018, the CPC made an 80 billion rupees forex loss as the rupee fell. The rupee was not allowed appreciate back in 2019 as private credit fell and reserves were re-built, under a so-called REER targeting strategy.",
    "Sri Lanka currency board will preserve rupee, impose discipline: Wijewardena",
    "Sri Lanka should set up a currency board to stop rupee depreciation: US economist",
    "Under such a credible peg, dollarization or parallel dollarization, economists would not get a chance to make such policy errors. Sri Lanka has had external trouble from shortly after a Latin America style central bank was set up in 1950 by a US Fed official. (Colombo/Mar30/2022)"
