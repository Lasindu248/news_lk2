Elpitiya Plantations PLC is the first Regional Plantations Company (RPC) in Sri Lanka to have implemented a learning programme of this nature.To recognise these employees, an awarding ceremony was held with the participation of the Managing Director, CEO, senior management members of Elpitiya Plantations PLC and the Chief Human Resources Officer of Aitken Spence PLC.",

These were identified as crucial focus areas to upskill and inculcate the values of the organisation and moreover to uplift the livelihoods of the plantations\u2019 community.There were 58 participants and more than 80% of them were female welfare officers. All participants demonstrated determination and passion during the learning module and essentially on learning the outcomes and how it would benefit them in their career.
