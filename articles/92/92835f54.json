    "COLOMBO (News 1st); International Financial Institutions, including the IMF, the ADB and the World Bank have extended their assistance towards Sri Lanka while\u00a0emphasizing the importance of maintaining social stability and\u00a0protecting democratic institutions in the country for them to assist Sri Lanka to effectively\u00a0manage the economic issues confronted by the country and the people.",
    "A Sri Lankan delegation, led by the Minister of Finance Ali Sabry, participated in the 2022\u00a0Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group held in\u00a0Washington DC during 18-22 April 2022. The delegation had meetings with several\u00a0International Financial Institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank, and bilateral\u00a0partners during their stay in Washington DC.",
    "According to the Ministry of Finance, the discussions were mainly focused on the present critical situation of the Sri Lankan\u00a0economy, and policies and measures to be implemented in the immediate, short, and medium term. The key areas discussed included",
    "(a) addressing the immediate need of restoring supply\u00a0chains of essential items, including fuel, LP gas, and pharmaceuticals",
    "(b) securing bridge\u00a0financing in the interim period until IMF financing with an economic programme is finalized",
    "(c) implementing short to medium term policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and\u00a0facilitate greener, more inclusive, sustainable, and stable growth in the country.",
    "Views were\u00a0exchanged on ways and means of supporting the people in the immediate term and the future\u00a0direction of engagement with Sri Lanka on a more coherent manner.",
    "The overwhelming support, cooperation and solidarity extended to the people of Sri Lanka by\u00a0all key IFIs, other institutions/agencies and friendly nations were extremely encouraging during\u00a0this critical juncture of the Sri Lankan economy, the Ministry of Finance states.",
    "Moreover, the delegation met with the IMF\u2019s Managing Director, First Deputy Managing Director and\u00a0Deputy Managing Director overseeing Sri Lankan affairs, as well as other senior officials at the\u00a0technical level. The meetings with the IMF were focused on securing an Extended Fund Facility\u00a0(EFF) to overcome the current difficult situation in the Sri Lankan economy with a medium term view, following the formal request made by Sri Lanka in mid-March 2022.",
    "A formal\u00a0request was also made for a Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) for consideration of the IMF to\u00a0obtain immediate financing into the country, which will be a bridge to the EFF. Entering into a\u00a0staff level agreement on an IMF programme as early as possible is important since it will help\u00a0unlock bridge financing facilities from other IFIs and bilateral partners.",
    "Among specific topics\u00a0discussed with the IMF were the debt restructuring process, revenue and expenditure measures\u00a0of the government, public financial management, reforms of state-owned enterprises and energy\u00a0pricing, strengthening social safety nets, monetary policy and Central Bank independence,\u00a0foreign exchange management, financial sector policies, and growth enhancing structural\u00a0reforms.",
    "Meanwhile, an IMF mission is expected to conduct in-person and/or virtual technical meetings\u00a0with Sri Lankan authorities in early May 2022 towards reaching an agreement within a short\u00a0period on a programme for Sri Lanka in parallel to the debt restructuring process.",
    "The meetings with the World Bank were focused on obtaining immediate foreign financing and\u00a0providing support to the Government to identify most appropriate policies to be implemented\u00a0under an IMF supported programme. During the discussion, World Bank\u2019s Vice President for the South Asia\u00a0Region and senior officials of the World Bank Group expressed commitment to provide\u00a0emergency support for essential medicines and health-related supplies, meals for school\u00a0children, and cash transfers for poor and vulnerable households.",
    "The World Bank\u2019s emergency\u00a0response package includes immediate financing for the purchase of essential medicines, and a\u00a0total package of around US dollars 600 million is expected over the immediate short term, short\u00a0term and the medium term, and the funds will be made available by repurposing some ongoing\u00a0projects, triggering Contingent Emergency Response Components (CERC) of some ongoing\u00a0projects, and also with new financing arrangements.",
    "Support to provide cooking gas, basic food\u00a0supplies, seeds and fertilizer and other essentials is also under discussion.",
    "The delegation also met the President of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and discussed\u00a0the Country partnership strategy and the way forward giving special focus on promoting\u00a0economic activities and productivity enhancement and improving the quality of growth by\u00a0promoting inclusiveness. The ADB expressed support for the Government in addressing the\u00a0present challenges and striding toward green, resilient, and inclusive growth.",
    "In addition, discussions were held with the South Asia Regional Director of International\u00a0Finance Corporation (IFC), the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme\u00a0(UNDP), the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u00a0(UNCTAD), and the Secretary-General of the Paris Club.",
    "The Indian delegation, led by their Minister of Finance, reassured India\u2019s enhanced commitment\u00a0to support Sri Lanka through several channels, including direct bridging finance in terms of\u00a0credit lines for petroleum and other essential imports and deferment of accumulated Asian\u00a0Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities as well as support through multilateral agencies.",
