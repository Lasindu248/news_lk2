    "Police will launch a special operation from today to identify individuals illegally storing and selling fuel.",
    "As per the Police, it is illegal to privately hold and sell fuel, without a filling station registered under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).",
    "\u201cAt present we have arrested two groups that have been involved in storing fuel illegally. From Tuesday (today) the raids on fuel stockpiling will be intensified,\u201d Sri Lanka Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa told journalists yesterday.",
    "Noting that the public is purchasing fuel in jerry cans, barrels, bottles, and other canisters, he said authorities were lenient over the matter due the shortage of fuel and scheduled power cuts \u2014 but it has been observed that individuals are misusing this leniency which have turned to illegal activities.",
    "\u201cThese fraudulent individuals are re-selling fuel with high-profit margins. Those who are in fuel queues for vehicles and other essential matters encounter difficulties due to such actions,\u201d SSP Thalduwa pointed out.",
    "Separately, the CPC yesterday announced that fuel will not be pumped into canisters, barrels and other portable containers at CEYPETCO filling stations on 12, 13 and 14 April. SSP Thalduwa called on the public to only purchase fuel sufficient for their requirement.",
    "He however said the public is allowed to purchase kerosene oil in jerry cans and bottles in required amounts."
