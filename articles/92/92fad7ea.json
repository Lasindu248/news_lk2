    "The 1990 Suwaseriya Emergency Ambulance Service, which was launched amid multiple obstacles in Sri Lanka under Indian grant assistance, is set to celebrate its sixth anniversary on July 28 this year.",
    "At the request of Government of Sri Lanka, the service was initially launched in 2016 in Western and Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka under an Indian grant of USD 7.56 million. The service, has now made tremendous progress so far. The project was methodically started with the fleet of 88 ambulances. Therefore, Sri Lanka owes a debt of gratitude to India as it has given further grant of 15.2 million of USD to get this project expanded throughout the country.",
    "Subsequently, the \u20181990\u2019 service was expanded to cover all nine provinces in the island, with a fleet of 297 ambulances \u2014 Sri Lanka purchased them from Tata Motors \u2014 with an additional Indian grant of $15.09 million. It is India\u2019s second largest grant project in the island, after the housing project of more than 60,000 houses, with a nearly $400 million grant.",
    "The idea of launching such an ambulance service came not at any high-level bilateral discussion. It was a proposal made by Dr Harsha de Silva, then a junior Minister and now opposition parliamentarian, after an ordeal he experienced while trying to hospitalise a friend who sustained serious injuries in a road accident.",
    "Suwasariya is a non-profit professional organization in India established by GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute) as a Government Partnership Program.",
    "This service was launched in Sri Lanka with the establishment of GVK EMRI Lanka in association with the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. During the first year, the Suwasariya Control Center received over 322,000 emergency calls and served over 32,000 patients. Official data reveals that there is an abundance of treatments mainly for patients with heart disease, trauma and stroke.",
    "However, when this service was introduced to Sri Lanka, many groups, including the Government Medical Officers' Association, wanted the project stopped, claiming that the service was a 'victim'. In many places, these parties have stated that substandard ambulances are provided for the sake of health, in which patients may die. But that was not true, and the ambulance service has grown to the point where it still receives more than 5,000 calls a day.",
    "Over the last few months, the \u20181990 Suwa Seriya\u2019 Emergency Ambulance service has doubled its efforts, attending not just to medical emergencies, but also helping us transfer COVID-19 patients, including those with co-morbidities, to hospitals swiftly.",
    "At present, a crew of 1,394 and 297 ambulances are involved in the operation and arrangements are also being made to introduce 112 new ambulances to the Suwasariya ambulance service. Initially, Suwasariya provided emergency services for accidents and especially unexpected ailments, including heart disease. But now it is also contributing to the hospitalization of people with mental illness.",
    "Furthermore, the Ministry of Health points out that this new system will enable the patient to receive the most accurate treatment quickly and facilitate the patient's relatives or guardians. Special training has been provided to the Suwaseriya staff for this purpose.",
    "Nevertheless, in line with the country's severe economic crisis, the Suwaseriya service, a vital resource from the Government of India, has come under severe pressure in recent times. It has been revealed that the reduction of the provision of Rs. 80 million provided by the General Treasury to Rs. 30 million has had a severe impact on the existence of the Suwasariya Ambulance Service in particular. Dr. Harsha de Silva recently revealed in Parliament that there is a risk of the Suwasariya ambulance service being stopped due to lack of funds. Former Minister of Health Prof. Channa Jayasumana at a media briefing held at the Government Information Department, said that he had discussed the matter with the then Minister of Finance Ali Sabri.",
    "He also stated that the Minister of Finance had agreed to provide adequate financial allocations. He further stated that Suwasariya has a fund of Rs. 600 million and despite that the government has decided to provide the necessary funds.",
    "\"I say with responsibility, Hon. Prime Minister, there is no money to run the Suwasariya. The chairman told me, what are we excited about? Today, more than a thousand people are brought to the intensive care unit every day. Everywhere in Sri Lanka, people are in a position to save their lives without dying due to 1990. Hon. Prime Minister, give me some money for that. These are the urgent needs. I do not know how to do it tomorrow without money. \u201d MP Dr. Harsha de Silva revealed in Parliament last week.",
    "However, India is now again coming forward to resolve this crisis. India is already in the process of supplying Sri Lanka with a stockpile of essential commodities, including medicines. India has donated this stock of medical supplies in response to requests made by various organizations and hospitals in various parts of the country.",
    "During the recent visit of Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankart to Sri Lanka in March 2022, representatives of the Suwaseriya Foundation and Member of Parliament Dr. Harsha de Silva pointed out the needs of the Sri Lankan medical profession. Part of this stock of medical supplies now donated by India will meet those needs. In addition, the medical aid will be provided to the Hambantota General Hospital, Peradeniya Teaching Hospital and the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Accordingly, on a special request made by Dr. Harsha de Silva, the Government of India is to provide a stock of medicines for the Sovereignty. It is planned to be handed over to Sri Lanka.",
    "In conclusion, it has to be noted that it is duty of the present and future leaders to preserve the 1990 Suwa Seriya, not for today, but for tomorrow, the next generation."
