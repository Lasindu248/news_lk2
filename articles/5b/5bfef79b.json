    "Hosted by Ambassador Dewi Gustina Tobing of Indonesia, the Ambassadors, High Commissioners, and other Government officials met as a group for the first time with an aim to meet potential new partners and explore innovative programs that can advance the role of women in Sri Lanka. Participants from the diplomatic and multilateral community included Ambassador Julie Chung of the United States, Ambassador Trine Joranli Eskedal of Norway, Ambassador Tanja Gonggrijp of the Netherlands, High Commissioner Sarah Hulton of the United Kingdom, Ambassador Rita Manella of Italy, Ambassador Demet Sekercioglu of Turkey, Ambassador Ho Thi Thanh Truc of Vietnam, and ILO Country Director Simrin Singh.",
