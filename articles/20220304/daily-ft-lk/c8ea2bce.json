    "Amnesty International said yesterday it has issued two new reports on Sri Lanka.",
    "One new report highlights the cases of two PTA detainees. It flags that the proposed PTA amendments fail to address critical gaps in the law to bring it in line with international standards, calls for a moratorium on the use of the Act until the PTA is repealed, for the Government to immediately review the detention of those held under the PTA, ensuring adequate access to fair bail hearings, and immediate release for all those not facing internationally recognisable charges.",
    "Another new report provides an update on the rights of victims of enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka. The report looks into a new dimension of human rights violations facing victims - this time in the form of harassment, intimidation, surveillance and restrictions on their freedom to protest.",
    "It also provides a critical analysis of the domestic initiatives set up to address the issues of the forcibly disappeared and reflects on the status of three emblematic cases."
