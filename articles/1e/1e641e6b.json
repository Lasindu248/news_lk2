    "A paddy field being reclaimed to build the Bird Park project",
    "At present reclamation activities are underway at an 80-acre paddy land close to Galwala Road in Mirihana and Pita Kotte Rajamaha Viharaya. As a result residents of the area who have been engaged in cultivation for years are unable to continue with cultivation activities. This paddy land was reclaimed on several times based on the requirements of politicians. However paddy cultivation was possible even then.",
    "However, due to a bird park project which was commenced in Madiwela area a few months ago, farmers in the area are no longer permitted to engage in cultivation. Reportedly, this project initiated by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and centred around Madiwela, Pita Kotte and Mirihana is to be carried out at the cost of three billion rupees. There is a sign board indicating the expected duration of the project; the project commencing in July 2021 and scheduled to end in July 2023.",
    "There are people who have been cultivating on this land since the 70s. This paddy land was taken over by the Government in 1982 with the building of the new parliament in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte under Paragraph 9 of the Land Reclamation Act. At present this paddy land is under the purview of the UDA. With the construction of the new parliament paddy lands in Galwala area in Mirihana were indicated as a catchment area and taken over. The lands were taken under the Government while providing compensation to the landowners and they were allowed to cultivate. To this day people have cultivated the land as tenant farmers and paddy landowners. As per subparagraph F of Paragraph 24 of the Agricultural Productivity Act no 02 of 1972, six rupees are charged annually from agricultural lands. These people also paid these taxes till 1990.",

    "These farmers, who cultivated continuously from 1970 to 2020, also received fertilizer from the Government, according to the members of the Sri Jayewardenepura Mirihana United Farmers Organization. They also possess evidence to prove that they have been cultivating the paddy land in the 253 Grama Seva Division in Mirihana North under the UDA for 32 years. Ever since the beginning of the bird park project they have not been allowed to cultivate the land, these members complain. The requests made to the UDA to temporarily allow paddy cultivation or any other cultivation- for the time being- have been ignored. According to the Mirihana Farmers Organization Government institutions do not allow them to cultivate their lands while the Government advises people to cultivate on all lands as a solution to the prevailing food crisis.",
    "When the bird park project is underway, paddy lands which are not even relevant to the project are being reclaimed with the permission of the UDA, according to W. M. Sarath Chandrasiri, who is a farmer. Around 40 acres near Pitawella Road on Parakum Mawatha, Pita Kotte Rajamaha Vihara Road are being reclaimed, according to him. \u201cThis time we are cultivating without permission. The UDA doesn\u2019t allow any cultivation. The price of rice has increased. People have no food. They do not allow us to cultivate and there is no financial assistance from the Government. The Bodhi tree of the Paramita Dharma Institute on Buwanekaba Mawatha on Pitawella Road is located at present where the old Kamatha existed. The Bodhi tree has been present since then. These lands are reclaimed to construct the bird park,\u201d he added.",
    "P. Premaratne, a resident of Pitawella Road, Mirihana in Pita Kotte is an active member of the Sri Jayewardenepura Mirihana United Farmers\u2019 Organization. \u201cAllow us to cultivate at least temporarily even with the construction of the bird park. We have informed almost every politician in this regard,\u201d Premaratne added.",

    "This bird park is being built without allowing farmers to cultivate land to facilitate the requirement of a associate of businessman Nissanka Senadhipati, according to locals from Mirihana. The person mentioned here is Ajith Gallage and he is a close associate of the Rajapaksas, the residents of Mirihana added. Anyone visiting the area can witness that these lands are reclaimed using unclean soil and waste material without following the recommended standard of paddy land reclamation. After reclaiming the paddy lands, the old canals were deepened. These canals were seen filled with waste material. Ministries including the Environmental Ministry of Sri Lanka inspected the area to inform about the improper reclamation activities, according to locals. Henchmen of people in charge of the project allow lorries to unload garbage to these lands and charge them to dump garbage, locals complained.",
    "The manner in which the bird park project is handled is discreet and the reason for that is unknown, according to locals. \u201cEven the President came to see how these lands are reclaimed using waste material,\u201d locals added.",
    "Eyewitnesses affirmed that the president arrived by a tuk tuk early in the morning with two bodyguards and watched the land reclamation process from the temple. Locals questioned whether the president allowed these activities to take place because the project was initiated by one of his associates. These locals had more to share about the questionable happenings.",
    "\"Allow us to cultivate at least temporarily even with the construction of the bird park - P. Premaratne (Resident of Pitawella Road)\"",
    "The locals add that they are trying to cause a huge destruction by constructing a bird park and hotels here and in the process want to remove villagers by destroying their houses. \u201cSenadhipathi is behind these activities. The foundation was laid with the commencement of the bird park construction activities. These locals say that Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has affirmed that cabinet approval has been received to ensure that not a single house is destroyed as a result of constructing the bird park project. If that is true, critics wonder why the UDA still wants to destroy the houses!",
    "Gallage was granted the bird park project following a tender procedure. A UDA spokesperson maintained that there is no legal issue associated with the tender procedure connected to this project. Ironically the newspaper advertisement calling for tenders only received one tender application and it was from Gallage. His tender application contained higher price rates than the state estimated figures and therefore his application was accepted, the UDA spokesperson said. \u201cAt present there is an issue regarding the boundaries of the bird park. Two houses will be removed and these residence owners will be offered alternatives; mainly to sort out an issue that exists regarding the boundaries of the project. \u201cThe illegal houses will be made legal. This project is constructed close to the Parliament. Gallage will receive 37 acres on a 30-year lease. He is also in charge of the bird park in Hambantota. We cannot allow paddy cultivation when we have leased the lands to Gallage as he has paid a sum of money. Only a small land close to the temple is cultivated. The rest of the area is not used for cultivation. Soon we will permit cultivation in areas that do not fall under the project,\u201d he added.",
    "\"These lands are reclaimed using unclean soil and waste material without following the recommended standard of paddy land reclamation\"",
    "\"The UDA is yet to mark the boundaries and hand over the land. Now garbage is brought to the land from everywhere. I want to have a clear land. My tender application for the land was accepted. I paid off the due amount of money. But the land hasn\u2019t been handed over as yet - Ajith Gallage\"",
    "Mirihana locals maintain that the area, which has come under the spotlight, was cultivated on for 40-50 years. \u201cWe do not want a bird park. The cultural background here is different. 2-3 families live in the same house. These villagers live a difficult life. The youth has become victims of drug abuse. A bird park is unnecessary to this area. The lives of residents are at stake to cater to the needs of a few,\u201d they added.",
    "Ven. Batapola Medananda Thera of Paramita Dharma Institute said that the villagers wanted to cultivate the available paddy lands to overcome the food crisis. \u201cIt would be helpful if the authorities can allow us to cultivate the land. Back then this area was a paddy land and the old Kamatha was where the Bo tree stands now,\u201d he added.",
    "This writer visited Pitawella Road area on June 6 to investigate on the land reclamation activities. After our visit, several UDA officers had visited the area and informed the residents to refrain from giving details about the bird park project to newspapers, according to locals in the area. \u201cThey told that if we provide information, they may not issue licences to lands,\u201d a local of the area said. Such action by officials leaves one wondering why these officers fear the leaking of information about this project and also pops the question on whose needs this project is being constructed? People are not allowed to cultivate when there is an inevitable food crisis; as foretold by the Government. Critics say that they do not know whether the construction activities of a bird park in place of cultivation activities could help people beat hunger.",
    "\"By cultivating 15000 acres in the Western Province we can provide paddy to the whole country to last for about three months. We request paddy land owners and businessmen in the province to help us with our movement. We will also teach a lesson to those officers who go against the law and neglect their duties - Anuradha Thennakoon National Agrarian Collective Chairman\"",
    "A spokesperson of Maharagama Agrarian Services Department said that fertilizer was provided to cultivate paddy lands in Mirihana. \u201cThe paddy lands were cultivated before the commencement of the bird park project. The UDA officers had informed that the remaining paddy lands would be given to farmers to cultivate on once this project concludes,\u201d the Maharagama Agrarian Services Department spokesman added. Attempts made to contact the UDA officer in charge of Mirihana area proved futile.",
    "When inquired, Ajith Gallage said that he had not received the land from the UDA. \u201cThe UDA is yet to mark the boundaries and hand over the land. Now garbage is brought to the land from everywhere. I want to have a clear land. My tender application for the land was accepted. I paid off the due amount of money. But the land hasn\u2019t been handed over as yet. The UDA officers are lying. They asked me to receive one plot of the land. There are many lands. I wanted to have them all cleared. But instead, garbage from everywhere is dumped on the land.",
    "\"The paddy lands were cultivated before the commencement of the bird park project. The UDA officers had informed that the remaining paddy lands would be given to farmers to cultivate on once this project concludes - Maharagama Agrarian Services Department Spokesperson \"",
    "Cesspits of nearby houses are directed to the canals. I dug these canals at the cost of more than 15 million rupees. Now they are filled with garbage. Maharagama Municipal Council is dumping garbage. I assigned a person named Buddhika to manage this task and to set up fences. But I removed him later because he failed to do his duties. I am doing an environmentally friendly project. A similar project is being carried out successfully in Hambantota. We also import birds and have employed many. I applied for this project. Nissanka Senadhipathi has no connection with this project. I obtained the land from the UDA on lease for 33 years. I am the only one working with projects connected to birds. That was why I was the only one to submit a tender application. This project is environmentally friendly. Around 15000 trees will be planted, and this project will benefit the country,\u201d he added.",
    "A spokesperson of the Maharagama MC said that garbage had been dumped in Mirihana back then, but this activity is not happening at present. Attempts made to contact Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to inquire about the cabinet approval given to prevent the destruction of houses on Pitawella Road proved futile.",
    "\"Ministries including the Environmental Ministry of Sri Lanka inspected the area to inform about the improper reclamation activities\"",
    "Nissanka Senadhipathi could not be contacted as he is abroad. A spokesperson of Avant-Garde said that neither Senadhipathi nor the company has any connection with the bird park project in Madiwela. \u201cThe company mentioned on the advertisement boards regarding the project is a different company and has no connection to us,\u201d the spokesman added.",

    "National Agrarian Collective Chairman Anuradha Thennakoon said that the NAU would provide the leadership to people in Mirihana to cultivate paddy lands in the area as a solution to the impending food crisis. \u201cIn the upcoming season, every paddy land in the country should be cultivated. Given the fertilizer crisis lands which can be cultivated with a minimum amount of chemical fertilizer should be identified and cultivated. Western Province is the best place to start from. There are many paddy lands that have been abandoned for a long time for various reasons. Taking over the paddy lands in the Western Province under state institutions and distributing them to henchmen in the guise of development should be halted. There are 12500 hectares of paddy lands in the Western Province which can be cultivated. At present there are attempts to reclaim paddy lands using political power. Especially, paddy lands in urban areas such as Kotte, Maharagama, Kaduwela, Homagama and Kesbewa are reclaimed in a large scale with the intervention of political authorities,\u201d said Thennakoon.",
    "\"Eyewitnesses affirmed that the president arrived by a tuk tuk early in the morning with two bodyguards and watched the land reclamation process from the temple\"",
    "\u201cWe are ready to strengthen farmers in the Western Province to cultivate these paddy lands thereby challenging the misdeeds of authorities and politicians. We are preparing a National Agrarian Army consisting 50000 famers in the Western Province. We as the National Agrarian Collective will launch a farming campaign reviving King Saddhatissa\u2019s movement which will help find a solution to the impending famine. By cultivating 15000 acres in the Western Province we can provide paddy to the whole country to last for about three months. We request paddy land owners and businessmen in the province to help us with our movement. We will also teach a lesson to those officers who go against the law and neglect their duties. We will also teach an unforgettable lesson to those who use political power to control us,\u201d he added.",
    "Attempts made to contact UDA Chairman Maj. Gen. Udaya Nanayakkara to inquire about the bird park project in Madiwela proved futile."
