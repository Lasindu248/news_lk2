    "Such crises lead to depreciation, inflation, social unrest and political upheavals are normal. In Sri Lanka both the President and the ruling party, and opposition had expressed support for an IMF program.",
    "High corrective interest rates, growth collapses, business failures and bad loans then follow.",
