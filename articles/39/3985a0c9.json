    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will meet a delegation from the opposition Tamil National Alliance on Tuesday (15) for the first time since he assumed office, TNA parliamentarian Shanakyan Rasamanickam confirmed to EconomyNext.",
    "The meeting, long sought by the Tamil party coalition, will take place at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo and, according to the MP, will focus on outstanding issues such as a political solution the ethnic issue, devolution of power, and alleged land grabbing in the north,",
    "\u201cWe requested a meeting with the president when he got elected in 2019. Until July 2021 we didn\u2019t receive any positive feedback. In July, the President had given us a time and a date, and he cancelled in at the 11th hour. A day before the meeting, he called and said that he had to postpone the meeting the meeting indefinitely,\u201d said Rasamanickam.",
    "Later requests for a meeting, some written separately by TNA MPs in their individual capacities, had also gone unacknowledged , he said. More recently, on February 24, the MPs held a protest outside the president\u2019s office demanding a meeting to discuss the land issue.",
    "\u201cAs the TNA, we hope to discuss the long outstanding matter of a political solution, which is our party\u2019s main concern. It will mainly be about devolution of power and power sharing.",
    "\u201cThat will be the prime objective of the meeting, along with a discussion on the land issue,\u201d the MP said, noting that all other issues including the alleged land grab stems from the absence of a political solution.",
    "The Sunday Times, an English-language weekly, reported that Tuesday\u2019s meeting is the result of India\u2019s call to the government of Sri Lanka to address the \u2018aspirations of the Tamils\u2019 including the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The call was made India\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN Indra Mani Pandey in Geneva last week.",
    "\u201cFor us not to have land issues in the future, we must first discuss a political solution. We don\u2019t want to put a bandaid on the wound but cure the wound,\u201d said Rasamanickam.",
    "\u201cThere is no respect for the rule of law in the country or for the constitution. Recently, the Land Ordinance Amendments Bill was brought in for a second reading. Land powers are devolved to the provinces. However the minister in charge of land brought an amendment to the Land Ordinance without the consent of the provincial council, because there is no provincial council in place,\u201d the MP said.",
    "We can\u2019t be challenging every matter in the Supreme Court. That will be such a tedious job,\u201d he added.",
    "TNA parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran is currently in India where had attended the World Tamil Conference, and will be the main spokesperson for the party at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, said Rasamanickam. (Colombo/Mar14/2022)"
