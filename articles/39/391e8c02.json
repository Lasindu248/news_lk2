    "The Government has decided to declare Fridays a holiday for non-essential public sector workers for three months.",
    "The move was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting on Monday after considering the dire shortage and difficulties in sourcing fuel for both public and private transport for months.",
    "As per the Cabinet decision, all State institutions will be closed except for those providing essential services such as water, electricity, health, defence, education, transport, port, and airport services on Fridays for the next three months.",
    "In addition, the State employees will receive the necessary facilities to engage in agricultural activities during the Friday holiday in their backyards or elsewhere, to overcome the looming food shortage.",
    "The proposal to this effect tabled by the Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Minister Dinesh Gunawardena was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday."
