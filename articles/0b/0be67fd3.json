    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil\u00a0 National Alliance (TNA) is still undecided on a proposed no confidence motion (NCM) against the government, apprehensive that the premiership will be retained by the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or will otherwise go to a person who supported the 20th amendment to the constitution, an TNA MP said.",
    "TNA parliamentarian M A Sumanthiran told EconomyNext Wednesday (27) morning that the party will arrive at a decision once there is clarity.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen after the NCM. We don\u2019t want to fall from the frying pan to fire. We don\u2019t want anybody from the SLPP or people who voted for the 20th amendment to become the PM. We will decide once we have clarity,\u201d he said.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) is currently collecting signatures for an NCM against Sri Lanka\u2019s increasingly unpopular government. Former energy minister and now dissident government MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed 120 MPs will back the motion. The legislature comprises a total of 225.",
    "Sri Lanka is going through the worst economic crisis in the country\u2019s history due to a crippling dollar shortage brought about by, among other things, relentless money printing. Protests have erupted islandwide demanding the resignation of the government and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "Some government MPs themselves have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has said he has no plans to leave. (Colombo/Ap427/2022)"
