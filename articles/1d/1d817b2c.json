    "The strategic partner for this gala event will be Mastercard, while Corporate sponsors are SLT-Mobitel, NDB and Supreme Flora, with Host Hotel once again being the Cinnamon Grand.",
    "\u201cImagine a gender-equal world. A world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination. A world that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. A world where difference is valued and celebrated. Together we can forge women\u2019s equality. Collectively we can all #BreakTheBias.\u201d",
    "Advancing gender equality in the context of the climate crisis and disaster risk reduction is one of the greatest global challenges of the 21st century. The issues of climate change and sustainability have had and will continue to have, severe and lasting impacts on our environment, economic and social development. Those who are amongst the most vulnerable and marginalised experience the deepest impacts. Women are increasingly being recognised as more vulnerable to climate change impacts than men, as they constitute the majority of the world\u2019s poor and are more dependent on the natural resources which climate change threatens the most.",
    "At the same time, women and girls are effective and powerful leaders and change-makers for climate adaptation and mitigation. They are involved in sustainability initiatives around the world, and their participation and leadership results in more effective climate action. Continuing to examine the opportunities, as well as the constraints, to empower women and girls to have a voice and be equal players in decision-making related to climate change and sustainability is essential for sustainable development and greater gender equality. Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach. The theme for International Women\u2019s Day is aligned with the priority theme for the upcoming 66th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66) \u2013 \u201cAchieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes\u201d.",

    "Several women leaders will also address the audience on the theme \u2013 \u201c#BreaktheBias: Equality today for a sustainable tomorrow; Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\u201d, recognising the contribution of women and girls around the world, who are leading the charge on climate change adaptation, mitigation, and response, to build a more sustainable future for all, aligning their addresses to their respective areas of work and the IWD theme.",
