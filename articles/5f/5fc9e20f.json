    "The government will take a policy decision and allow the Railway Department to increase train fares, Railway General Manager (GMR) Dhammika Jayasundara said.",
    "In an address to the media, he stated that several new trains will be added to the existing fleet from today to help ease the office workers crowd.",
    "Also, he said that steps have been taken to add new trains in the future.",
    "\"At present, the railways charge only 20 to 24% of the bus fare. Therefore, our expenditure has increased significantly with the increase in the price of diesel. But it does not show a big increase in our income. Passengers avail this service at a minimal cost,\" he said.",
    "Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, the government will take a policy decision and allow the department to increase the train fares, the GMR added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
