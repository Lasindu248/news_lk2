    "The Janatha vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to revoke the state of emergency claiming that suppressing people's protests would result in more serious repercussions.",
    "JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that several organisations including the Bar Association and Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka have condemned the declaration of the state of emergency.",
    "He said the Government must listen to the people's voice rather than suppressing it and trying to remain in power using various tactics.",
    "Mr. Silva said the report that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was going to resign was yet another ploy to divert the people's protest.",
    "\"The whole country is aksing for the President to step down. So, first of all, he should resign intead of telling the Prime Minister to resign. Then, the Prime Minister should resign with the whole Cabinet,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
