    "CSE activities yesterday started on a positive note but that momentum was short-lived especially due to the sharp decline in the previous day\u2019s trading activities stemming from political instability and macro- economic issues, stock market analyst said.",
    "CSE investors are worried about the government\u2019s failure to find a sustainable solution to current burning issues because the country has reserves only for six weeks\u2019 imports, thanks to the Indian Line of Credit, which amounts to US $ one billion, analysts said.",
    "Further, the Asian Development Bank forecasts that the economy in Sri Lanka will dip to 2.4 per cent this year due to the Covid 19 pandemic situation and low forecasting of reserves and debt issues. This has created some panic for stock market investors, stock analysts added.",
