    "Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters' Union (SLRSMU) requested the Transport Minister to take immediate action to expand public transport network, namely trains, as people have gradually getting used to travel by train, instead using private vehicles.",
    "The Union's chief secretary said in a letter to the minister that the number of people who usually travel by train has increased due to the recent huge fuel price hike.",
    "Parallel to the recent fuel price increase, the train fares too have been\u00a0 increased. Therefore, a large number of people prefer to travel by trains to cut down their daunting expenses incur on travelling.",
    "The revenue gained after operating trains between Polgahawela-Fort, Negombo-Fort, Aluthgama-Fort- Maradana, and Avissawella-Fort have increased during the past few days.",
    "Therefore, the SLRSMU sent a letter explaining the situation and the Minister to take action to operate more trains to fill people's requirements, and run power-sets other than using a single locomotive to serve more passengers, add more compartments, cancel the trains that are not productive and to introduce a temporary time table while giving ear to commuters' views.
