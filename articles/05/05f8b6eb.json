    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) today called for further revisions on the proposed 21st Amendment\u00a0 to curtail more powers of the Executive President.",
    "SJB General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara told journalists that his party had already informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to revise the proposed legislation to prevent the President from holding any ministerial portfolio and to ensure that Parliament is allowed to elect a President.",
    "\u201cWe have also proposed some clauses pertaining to MPs who shift sides in Parliament.\u00a0 Accordingly we have proposed an amendment under which an MP who crosses over will be prevented from accepting any portfolio or any other reward for crossing over. Also we have proposed that only the Supreme Court could issue a stay order preventing disciplinary action against a political party in the event an MP shifts sides,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cThe SJB has also informed the Prime Minister that\u00a0 the\u00a0 21st amendment should be revised and approved by Parliament and then hold a referendum at an appropriate time,\u201d he said.",
    "Both Mr. Madduma Bandara and MP Talatha Athukorala said SLPP is trying to isolate the incumbent Prime Minister. \u201c This was evident on how SLPP acted\u00a0 during the election of Deputy Speaker,\u201d Ms. Athukorala said.(Yohan Perera)"
