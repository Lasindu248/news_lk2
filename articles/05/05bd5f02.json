    "Colombo (AsiaNews): A petition signed by about 200,000 people was recently delivered to the Government.",
    "Sponsored by the National Women\u2019s Movement for Economic Rights (NWMER), it demands the Government take immediate action against the economic crisis, which is particularly hard on women.",
    "\u201cPoverty, including food shortages, is on the rise in Sri Lanka,\u201d reads the petition. \u201cOrdinary farmers, fishermen, labourers, small manufacturers, small vendors, employees in the apparel industry and day labourers are suffering greatly and women have become the worst victims.\u201d",
    "The petition was handed to Co-operative Services, Marketing Development and Consumer Protection State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.",
    "\u201cOur role is to protect consumers,\u201d he told AsiaNews. \u201cToday, fulfilling these responsibilities has become a huge challenge because of the many problems that are beyond our control around the world.\u201d Nevertheless: \u201cWe strive to provide sustainable solutions.\u201d",
    "To this end, \u201cWe have agreed to launch a service through the implementation of cooperative schemes in the plantation sector and Free Trade Zones. Also, we agreed to continue to work on what can be done in other sectors [involving] women as well,\u201d Minister Alagiyawanna said.",
    "People complain of power cuts, fuel and gas shortages, lack of essential goods, of having to wait in line day and night and blame the Government for it.",
    "\u201cThese issues of economy, employment, security, education of children, health, and transport make women\u2019s lives very hard,\u201d said Lucia Mary, a women\u2019s representative in Vavuniya district, speaking to AsiaNews. Still, \u201cwe hope that some solution will be found in the future\u201d. Chandra Devanarayana, who chairs the Free Trade Zone Worker\u2019\u2019 Welfare Organisation, added that workers in these special zones have been told that they would be able to purchase goods at a discount and would have access to drugs approved by the State Pharmaceutical Corporation of Sri Lanka.",
