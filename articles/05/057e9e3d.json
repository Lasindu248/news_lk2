    "Discussing the new awards program, NLA 2022 by SLFFA Project Chairman Shavindra Dias said: \u201cIt\u2019s been quite some time since the industry has been recognised, both collectively and individually, which is why the NLA committee has been working tirelessly alongside the tremendously committed Panel of Judges, empowered by our sponsors and supported by numerous industry related organisations.\u201d",
    "Through the National Logistics Awards, which is intended to be a bi-annual program, SLFFA intends to recognise and encourage service providers in Sri Lanka\u2019s logistics space, while also creating greater awareness among the youth on this fast-growing industry full of opportunity. As the world emerges from the pandemic, logistics has become one of the most important industries globally. Having worked throughout the challenges and restrictions, the SLFFA believes that the industry is long overdue for much needed recognition of its outstanding achievements.",
    "The Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) was established in 1981 with the objective of bringing all freight forwarders and logistics providers under one umbrella, with a view to institutionalise and professionalise the trade. Today the Government, relevant Government agencies and the industry have recognised the SLFFA as the apex body representing the sector.
