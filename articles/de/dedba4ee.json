Earlier this month, an article was shared on social media that went viral, stating that Primer Rajapaksa has invested US $ 10 billion in companies of Serenity Group in Uganda.",
    "\u201cSerenity Group and its subsidiaries had an organic growth since its inception and provided employment for many Sri Lankans and Ugandans. We will proudly continue to support Sri Lanka through a steady flow of foreign remittances into the country,\u201d Serenity Group said in a statement to the media yesterday.",

    "\u201cThis was in May 2016 and this event was publicised along with the other politicians that were present on the day. We divested ourselves from the F&B businesses in 2020. All of our subsidiaries have been openly and proudly displayed on our website and it is only recently that we\u2019ve had downtime due to an IT issue,\u201d Serenity Group - Uganda said.",
    "Under the Serenity Group is also East Africa Concrete Products Limited (EACPL), the leading supplier of concrete poles for rural electrification projects in Uganda that was financed via equity investors and a commercial bank in Sri Lanka.

    "\u201cWe hope that our attempt to share our story, our history, values and vision will help the public to get a better grasp of the situation and answer many of the burning questions that have been fuelled by the low trust environment,\u201d Serenity Group said."
