    "All politicians representing the majority community huff and puff up the hills to Kandy all the way from Colombo, from time to time, and kneel before the Mahanayake Theras, seeking the latter\u2019s advice on almost everything. They also present the first copies of their election manifestos to the prelates and receive blessings. But they neither scruple to renege on their election pledges nor follow the Maha Sangha\u2019s counsel. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa are among those who often visit the Mahanayake Theras.",
    "It is heartening that Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter of the Siyam Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Tibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera, has decided not to meet politicians at his temple in protest against their refusal to heed a memorandum the Mahanayake Theras have sent them, spelling out how the present crisis could be resolved. Other prelates should emulate his example.",
    "The Buddhist prelates and other religious leaders have come forward to help resolve the present crisis, and put forth several proposals, the main being the formation of an all-party interim administration, which they want to govern the country and stabilise the economy with the help of a committee of experts to be set up, before holding a general election for the people to elect a new government. Curiously, the politicians who called for an interim administration are now backpedalling instead of supporting the ongoing efforts to tackle the crisis.",
    "The Mahanayake Theras have their work cut out to secure the support of the political leaders for the implementation of their proposals.",
    "President Rajapaksa is reported to have agreed in principle to form an interim administration. Prime Minister Rajapaksa makes conflicting statements; he says he will continue to be the PM, but at the same time he says the President is free to appoint a new PM. Even if the President brings himself to form an interim administration at the expense of his elder brother, Mahinda, he is not likely to succeed in his endeavour; not all other parties are willing to join an all-party Cabinet.",
    "Opposition and SJB leader Premadasa has said in no uncertain terms that his party will not join an interim government. The JVP has also rejected the idea of power sharing under President Rajapaksa. The position of these parties on the proposed interim government has been consistent unlike that of the SLFP, which seems to be blowing hot and cold.",
    "One wonders whether SLFP leader and former President Maithripala Sirisena is going to make an about-turn on his party\u2019s call for the establishment of an interim administration, if what he said in his May Day speech, on Sunday, in Polonnaruwa, is any indication. After taking part in a protest march, where participants called upon the government to resign, Sirisena berated the incumbent administration, declared that his party was fully supportive of the protesting public, and added in the same breath that the people wanted the government leaders to step down so that they could elect a new government. Earlier in his speech, he said his intention was to form an SLFP government. Thus, reading between the lines, one may wonder whether Sirisena is now for a snap general election, which is the least desirable option at this juncture.",
    "Sirisena has earned notoriety for policy U-turns, which are legion. Close on the heels of the Mirihana mayhem, the SLFP, on 01 April, called upon President Rajapaksa to appoint a caretaker government, and its position was endorsed by the 11-party dissident group of the SLPP. Thereafter, the SLFP wrote to the President calling for the establishment of an interim government, which it said, was the only way out. It warned that unless its demand was met within one week, all its 14 MPs would pull out of the government. The Cabinet save Prime Minister Rajapaksa resigned on 03 April. One week later, Sirisena himself told the media that if the President agreed to set up an interim administration without members of the Rajapaksa family in it, the party leaders could discuss ways and means of setting about forming it. On 30 April, Sirisena, after returning from a meeting with the President, announced at a media briefing that the latter had agreed to appoint an interim government with a new Prime Minister. Now, he seems to have changed his tune. A clarification is called for.",
    "Buddhist monks have issued an ultimatum to President Rajapaksa. They want him to carry out the Mahanayake Theras\u2019 proposals before 15 May. It takes two to tango. There\u2019s the rub. If the Opposition refuses to be party to an interim government, the proposals at issue will be a non-starter.",
    "The current situation is not conducive to an electoral contest. Even the Election Commission is reported to have said an interim government should be set up. What needs to be tackled urgently is the economic meltdown, which is the mother of all crises, and an election can wait. An interim government will help bring about political stability, which is a sine qua non of economic recovery. The Mahanayake Theras\u2019 proposals are therefore pragmatic and sensible.",
    "But how do the members of the Maha Sangha propose to make the Opposition, the SLFP, etc., agree to join the interim government to be set up. It looks as if they had to issue an ultimatum to all political leaders with parliamentary representation.",
