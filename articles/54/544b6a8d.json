    "He said Sri Lanka will seek another $500 million credit line from India for fuel, which would suffice for about five weeks.",
    "The government would also look for support from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and bilateral partners including China, the United States, Britain and countries in the Middle East.",
    "\u201cWe know where we are, and the only thing is to fight back,\u201d Sabry said. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201d",
    "Discussions are ongoing with China on a $1.5 billion credit line, a syndicated loan of up to $1 billion and a request from Sri Lanka\u2019s president in January to restructure some debt.",
    "\u201cHopefully we will be able to get some relief which would help ...until larger infusions come in,\u201d he said.",
    "Beijing and New Delhi have long jostled for influence over the island off India\u2019s southern tip, with the country pulling closer to China under the powerful Rajapaksa family.",
    "But in recent weeks, as the economic crisis deepened, Sri Lanka has leaned heavily on assistance from India.",
