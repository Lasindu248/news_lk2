    "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) during its recent meeting drew special attention to the quantity of ethanol imported for use in Sri Lanka and the lack of proper regulation of importing institutions, according to the Communications Department of Parliament.",

    "It was also emphasized that the quantity of ethanol imported for other products, including pharmaceuticals, other than alcohol, and the proper use of ethanol for those products should be taken into consideration.",
    "Furthermore, the Committee inquired into the issuance of licenses for the importation of vehicles and spare parts to Sri Lanka.

    "Although the officials of the Department of Import and Export Control were informed about this matter in the year 2016, the Committee expressed its displeasure that this work has not been done so far and considering the importance of this, the Chairman of the Committee decided to appoint a Sub-Committee to inquire into its progress.",
    "Also, attention was drawn to the subsequent transfer of vehicles imported under the prize scheme to various parties. Accordingly, after the vehicles were imported under the gift scheme, the officers present were asked about the transfer of the vehicles to other parties.",
    "The officials informed the Committee that the vehicles so imported on a tax concession basis could not be transferred to another party until 05 years have elapsed. They stated that even after 5 years of such transfers, the necessary procedures have been put in place to recover the normal tax value of the relevant vehicles.",
    "The Committee also emphasized the importance of proper follow-up and regulation of licenses for vehicles imported under the gift scheme.",
    "The Committee inquired regarding the loss of customs duty of 114.6 million rupees due to incorrect customs associated classification numbering of 33 used cars in the year 2017 contrary to the provisions of Gazette Notification No. 1933/13 dated 21st September 2015, Gazette Notifications for Vehicles subject to Licensing Control and Instructions given by the Minister of Development Strategies and the Minister of International Trade and the Minister of State to the Controller of Imports and Exports.
