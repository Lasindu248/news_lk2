    "All Island Container Transport Owners' Federation (AICTOF) today decided to increase container freight transport rates by 35%, AICTOF chairman Sanath Manjula said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that they have decided to increase the import and export container transport costs with the increase of the price of one litre of auto diesel by Rs.111.",
    "During the previous fuel price increase, the import and export container transport costs were increased by Rs. 60, he said.",
    "Meanwhile, due to a shortage of spare parts, the transport operators are unable to continue with the services, as well as prices of tyres, batteries and lubricants, which have increased by 50%. We need a price increase more than 35%, but we cannot because the importers and exporters face difficulties with the government's decision to limit imports and exports.",
    "The container freight transport rate revision will take effect from midnight today, the AICTOF chairman said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
