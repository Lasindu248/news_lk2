The legal draftsmen are currently preparing bills for this purpose. Although the requirements to be fulfilled for the registration of a marriage should be included in the Marriage Registration Ordinance, the Ordinance does not include provisions regarding foreign marriage registration, annulment of marriage or judicial separation. Therefore, the cabinet of ministers approved the proposal made by the minister of justice to amend the said Act and to instruct a legal draftsman to prepare a Bill to that effect",
