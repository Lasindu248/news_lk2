    "Sti Lanka faces \u201csolvency\u201d issues because of risks stemming from unsustainable debt levels that jeopardize the nation\u2019s economy, according to International Monetary Fund staff.",
    "\u201cBased on staff analysis, the fiscal consolidation necessary to bring debt down to safe levels would require excessive adjustment over the coming years, pointing to a clear solvency problem,\u201d the IMF said in its Article IV consultation report, released Friday in Washington.",
    "The full report provides further analysis of the South Asian island nation\u2019s debt and finances. A summary of the report released earlier in the month said Sri Lanka faced unsustainable debt levels and needed a \u201ccredible and coherent\u201d strategy to restore stability.",
    "The country\u2019s \u201cdebt overhang,\u201d along with persistent fiscal and balance-of-payments shortfalls, \u201cwill constrain growth and jeopardise macroeconomic stability in both the near and medium term,\u201d the report said.",
    "\u201cRollover risk is very high,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cFX debt service needs of $7 billion each year will require access to very large amounts of external financing at concessional rates and long maturities, sustained over many years.\u201d",
    "Since the IMF board considered the staff report in late February, a surge in oil prices and the loss of tourists because of the war in Ukraine exacerbated its foreign exchange crisis, forcing the government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to seek IMF aid.",
    "Negotiations on a possible aid package are expected to start in April, when Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, a brother of the president, travels to Washington.",
    "The spiraling crisis has also led the country to raise interest rates, devalue the local currency and curb non-essential imports.",
    "Sri Lanka has about $2 billion of reserves against $3.9 billion of foreign-currency debt due for the remainder of 2022, according to Bloomberg calculations based on central bank data. This includes $1 billion of sovereign bonds maturing in July.",
    "\u201cWith the government indicating that it is seeking a closer engagement with the IMF, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka stands ready to cooperate in such an engagement,\u201d the monetary authority said in an amended statement Saturday.",
    "Sri Lanka has to be \u201cprepared to manage the negatives,\u201d central bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said on Thursday, referring to entering an IMF programme, but did not elaborate.",
