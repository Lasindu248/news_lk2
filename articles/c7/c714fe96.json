  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka may have to convince the international community more on its human rights efforts before another resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) meeting in September as the island nation has been asked to do more to address past alleged rights abuses.",
    "Before the Sri Lankan delegation left to Geneva to participate in the 49th UNHRC session, the government attempted to activate some of its domestic processes including the Office of Missing Person (OMP) and the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).",
    "The government also tabled an amendment to the country\u2019s anti-terrorism law, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA,) in parliament and released a number of people arrested under the PTA including lawyer Hejaz Hizbullah and poet Ahnaf Jazeem, long demanded by international rights groups.",
    "However, it also faced new allegations that were forwarded at the latest UNHRC session including the government\u2019s alleged failure to find the masterminds of the 2019 Easter Sunday attack and the alleged muzzling of opposition legislators and minorities critical of the government.",
    "Apart from these, individual complaints by Sri Lankans also have been sent in a confidential manner to the UNHRC about how their fundamental rights are being breached under successive governments, sources who were aware of such complaints told EconomyNext.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Catholic Church leader Cardinal Malcom Ranjith\u2019s meeting with the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has sought to change the perception of Catholic nations, especially in the Latin American belt, a source who has the knowledge on the meetings said.",
    "According the resolution passed at the UN body last year, Bachelet has received a mandate to collect evidence of crimes allegedly committed during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war, which ended with an upsurge of alleged civilian deaths attributed to both the Sri Lankan army and Tamil Tiger rebels.",
    "Many rights activists and some Western nations still see Sri Lanka\u2019s measures including proposed amendments to the anti-terror law, reactivating the work of the OMP and ONUR as attempts to hoodwink the international community.",
    "However, none of these measures managed to convince the UN and international community.",
    "Bachelet on Friday\u2019s session in Geneva said there have been some recent signs of increased engagement by the government with her office and certain steps to initiate reforms.",
    "\u201cI encourage the Government to take further steps to address the fundamental problems with the PTA, as well as undertake the deeper legal, institutional and security sector reforms that are critically needed, to put an end to impunity and prevent any recurrence of past violations,\u201d Bachelet\u00a0said.",
    "\u201cRegrettably, the past year has also seen further obstruction and setbacks to accountability. Victims and their families continue to be denied truth and justice. \u00a0And the Government\u2019s response to criticism has constricted democratic and civic space, including for essential human rights advocacy.",
    "\u201cTwo years after the expression of commitments to pursue an \u201cinclusive, domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process\u201d before this Council, the Government has still not produced a credible road map on transitional justice towards accountability and reconciliation.\u201d",
    "President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP)-led coalition, which earlier opposed all views on addressing past rights abuses from the West, the UN, and global rights groups, has been on reverse gear since the country started to face an economic and debt crisis.",
    "The European Union has threatened to withdraw Sri Lanka\u2019s access to the GSP plus trade concession worth over 500 million US dollars if Sri Lanka does not fulfil its commitments including repealing the PTA as it agreed to in 2016.",
    "Some western nation including Canada and the United States have already imposed targeted sanctions on military personnel who are accused of war crimes.",
    "\u201cThe current Government has not only demonstrated its unwillingness to pursue accountability \u2013 it has incorporated military officials implicated in alleged war crimes into the highest levels of Government, reinforcing a narrative of impunity,\u201d the UN rights chief said.",
    "Though Sri Lanka started to address most of the rights concerns, it hardly had the time to reconcile with minorities which have accused the SLPP-led coalition of not taking strong action against racism and targeted violence against minorities since it came to power.",
    "\u201cThe expression of ethno-religious nationalism in State institutions has become more visible, increasing the marginalisation and fear of minority communities, and undermining reconciliation,\u201d Bachelet\u00a0said.",
    "\u201cSince the end of 2020, we have noted a significant increase in land disputes, mainly related to Buddhist heritage conservation or forestry protection, that are exacerbating grievances of minority communities and creating new tensions.\u201d",
    "The UN rights boss also questioned the independence of country\u2019s key commissions and institutions after the passage of the 20th amendment to strengthen the powers enjoyed by the president.",
    "\u201cI am also deeply concerned by continued reports of surveillance, harassment and intimidation of civil society organisations, human rights defenders and journalists by police and intelligence services,\u201d Bachelet\u00a0said.",
    "\u201cRepeated incidents of deaths in custody and in alleged armed encounters with police are alarming. We also continue to receive allegations of ill-treatment and torture by police and military. This highlights the importance of fundamental security-sector reforms.\u201d",
    "She also said the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings and religious leaders also continue to call for justice, reparation and a full account of the circumstances of those attacks, in particular the role of the security establishment.",
    "Bachelet\u2019s comments on Easter Sunday victims came after Sri Lanka\u2019s Malcom Cardinal Ranjith personally visited Geneva and placed his statement officially to the UNHCR on the plight of the victims in the attack along with a request to ensure justice.",
    "The Cardinal said the Easter Sunday attack \u2013 which killed 269 including 47 foreign nationals from 14 countries \u2013 first appeared to be the work of Islamic extremists but subsequent investigations indicated that \u201cthis massacre was part of a grand political plot.\u201d",
    "He said the SLPP-led government has failed to mete out justice to the victims despite repeated requests and there are attempts to harass and intimidate those who clamour for justice instead of uncovering the truth behind the attack and prosecuting those responsible.",
    "Many rights activists say the Cardinal\u2019s request could become a game changer in the future in forcing Sri Lanka\u2019s government to address alleged past human rights violations, given the likelihood of Catholic-dominated nations will now also call on the government to address UNHRC demands.",
    "Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s Core Group said its concerns over surveillance and intimidation of civil society persists and detentions, threats and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders continue while the proposed changes to the PTA are very limited and its longstanding concerns still remain.",
    "\u201cThe new \u2018One Country One Law\u2019 taskforce risks undermining Sri Lanka\u2019s pluralist society. We urge Sri Lanka to ensure that this taskforce\u2019s work is inclusive and non-discriminatory,\u201d the UK\u2019s Global Ambassador for Human Rights Rita French in her statement on behalf of \u00a0the core group said.",
    "Human rights activists and officials who visited Geneva said the sessions on Sri Lanka for the first time saw Christians and Sinhalese speaking against human rights violations by an incumbent government for the first time.",
    "Opposition legislator Harin Fernando and Cardinal Ranjith were given 1.5-minute slot each under the NGO time slot where 10 NGOs were given the opportunity to speak.",
    "\u201cIt is an alarm bell for Sri Lanka,\u201d said a rights activist based in Geneva told EconomyNext.",
    "\u201cNow pressure is mounting on Sri Lanka as most countries spoke on Monday asked it to address concerns.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka for its part said there were serious anomalies and weaknesses in Bachelet\u2019s\u00a0report presented to the Council.",
    "However, some diplomats based in Sri Lanka say Sri Lanka\u2019s credibility among the international community has eroded due to its past record and another resolution is likely in September depending on the government\u2019s responses to UNHRC\u2019s call to address human rights abuses.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Minister G L Peiris criticized the UNHRC\u2019s move to find evidence against the government\u2019s past human rights abuses.",
    "\u201cThe fundamental deficiency is its intolerably intrusive character, impinging as it does on core functions and responsibilities of organs of the Sri Lankan State, overwhelmingly mandated by the people of our country at three successive elections\u201d he told the UNHRC,\u201d he told in his statement addressing the Council.",
    "\u201cDespite our rejection of the resolution, we will continue our voluntary international undertakings on human rights and engage with the United Nations, including with this Council,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe are dismayed by the High Commissioner\u2019s unwarranted onslaught on seminal institutions of our country which function under the aegis of Sri Lanka\u2019s Constitution and legal system, emanating from a rich and varied cultural heritage, and are subject to stringent review processes which form an integral part of our tried and tested laws.\u201d",
    "On Tuesday, Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry said the country \u201creceived overwhelming support from countries of the Global South who expressed support for the Government\u2019s significant efforts towards reconciliation and reiterated the importance of objective and constructive cooperation as the fundamental basis for multilateral engagement\u201d.",
    "\u201cOf the 45 countries that spoke at the Interactive Dialogue, 31 spoke in support of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka received cross-regional support from a broad spectrum of states of South, South East and Central Asia and the African Group,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in its statement.
