    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Some witnesses of a lethal police shooting in Rambukanna, Sri Lanka, are reluctant to come forward with statements on what really happened due to fear of police intimidation, Bar Association of Sri Lana (BASL) President Saliya Peiris said.",
    "In a letter addressed to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Peiris wrote on Wednesday (20) that injured civilians at the Kegalle hospital and other witnesses are afraid to make statements due to fear intimidation on the part of some police officers.",
    "\u201cPlease ensure that there is no interference whatsoever with the witnesses by the police and please take steps to ensure that the statements of these witnesses are recorded by police officers who do not belong to the stations which were involved in the incident and who will not interfere with the independence of these witnesses,\u201d wrote Peiris.",
    "\u201cPlease note that any conduct which will interfere with the independence of these witnesses will be taken serious note by the BASL and appropriate follow up action taken,\u201d he added.",
