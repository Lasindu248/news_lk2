    "Senura Yapa Senadipathi, the son of Avant-Garde Company Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi, said yesterday that the way people continue to harass him online is disgusting.",
    "Sharing a story on his Instagram account, Senura said his family has not done anything wrong to Sri Lanka and it is a shame for all the harassment given to them in return for the help they have done to so many people.",
    "\u201cEveryone who has been harassing us, know that we haven\u2019t done anything wrong to our country. We have helped so many people, donated a lot, provided housing and food and protected this country to the limits. It is honestly a shame for all the harassment given to us in return.\u201d",
    "He also made a request from the people. \u201cThink about how you would feel if it happened to you before you go insulting people online. It is disgusting,\u201d he said.",
    "Nissanka Senadhipathi is a very influential figure in the current government although he holds no government positions. Media reported that he and his family members had left the Katunayake Airport for the Maldives early this week. At that time, the computer system and security camera system at the airport were jammed, and the group had made arrangements to enter the aircraft through the departure terminal at Katunayake Airport.",
    "Meanwhile, JVP MP Vijith Herath filed a petition in Parliament on Tuesday, requesting government to take the required steps to enlist the help of INTERPOL to apprehend Nissanka Senadhipathi, whom he claims has robbed public monies."
