    "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement said it noted the escalation of the situation in the vicinity of the protest at Galle Face as a result of the heavy presence of police personnel and the barricading of some of the roads leading to Galle Face where even pedestrians have been prevented from travelling.",
    "The attention of the BASL has been drawn by its members and by the public, that certain barricades have been fitted with spikes and covered with black material and that these barricades may well cause serious injuries to persons.",
    "\u201cWe once again call upon the Government, the Inspector General of Police, and all police officers and the armed forces to act with utmost restraint in all circumstances. They are duty-bound to ensure the safety of the protesters and the public and the right of the people to dissent in a peaceful manner and also the freedom of movement of the citizen. Any violence whatsoever from whatever quarter will have serious repercussions for the country,\u201d BASL said."
