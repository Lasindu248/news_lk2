  "body_lines": [
    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena said there is growing animosity between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe like a rivalry.",
    "He said it was similar to the rivalry between him as the president and Mr. Wickremesinghe as the prime minister at that time.",
    "It was quite clear that there was no coordination, mutual understanding or unity between the two and that was why the Gotabaya Rajapakse \u2013 Ranil Wickremesinghe rule has become a total failure, dragging the country and its 22 million people into an unfathomable abyss, he added.",
    "Addressing the media at the party office last morning, Mr. Sirisena said the President and Prime Minister had made it a habit now to call meetings separately of public officers, representatives of the private sector and trade unions and issue instructions.",
    "\u201cThough utterly failed in their performance, they keep advising all and sundry in a challenging manner to each other and sometimes it seems the two are engaged in a competition attempting to beat each other,\u201d he said.",
    "Mr. Sirisena reiterated that the most pragmatic and timely solution to the current economic, political and social mess in the country was to form an all-party government as agreed upon by President Rajapakse and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe after passing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.(Sandun A Jayasekera)"
