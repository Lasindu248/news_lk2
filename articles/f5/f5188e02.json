  "body_lines": [
    "With the sufficient rainfall in the hydro-catchment areas, there is no need of generating electricity using thermal power plants, and the maximum power cut would be five hours, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union said.",
    "They said the Soijitz and West Coast Power plants only have diesel in hand, but no other thermal power plants have the fuel. The fuel in hand with Soijitz power plant would only be sufficient for one day, while the West Coast Power plant has diesel for a maximum of two days, the union said.",
    "However, the hydro and wind power electricity generation have increased.",
    "Considering all power generation sources, except the thermal power plants, the maximum power shedding hours would be five, the CEB union added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
