    "Refuting claims that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was behind the unrest subsequent to May 9 incident, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake today questioned as to why police and army were not called into control the situation.",
    "He told Parliament that the JVP members were not connected to the acts of arson and violence after May 9 incident and requested the government to conduct an impartial probe into the attack on peaceful protesters and the acts of violence that followed thereafter.",
    "The JVP stalwart said the suspects who were arrested over the incident in Gampaha, Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya, Deniyaya and Devundara were not members of the JVP.",
    "He said police and the army were not summoned to control the situation which arose after May 9 incident because of the power struggle of the President and the Prime Minister.",
    "\"The army and the police are under the President. Why they were not called into prevent the attacks and acts of arson? The President wanted to embarrass the Prime Minister and create a situation where he was forced to step down. The President's group claim that the Prime Minister wanted to exit after leaving the whole country in jeopardy,\" he said.",
    "The JVP Parliamentarian said the people are in tremendous pressure and increasing frustration due to shortage of fuel, gas and fertilizer which burst out as violent repercussions after the attack on peaceful protesters, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
