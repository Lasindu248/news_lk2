    "The UNP\u2019s call for formulating a national policy to revive the country\u2019s economy, should have been done when they were in power, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP J. C. Alawathuwala said yesterday.",
    "Mr. Alawathuwala was referring to the remarks made by UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardene who said a national policy has to be formulated and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will revive the economy in 48 hours if he is appointed as the Prime Minister.",
    "\u201cMr. Wickremesnghe should have done what he pledges to do now when he was in power,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt was former Minister Abeywardene who allowed the Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to listen to the cabinet meeting during the Yahapalana government through his phone,\u201d Mr. Alawathuwala added.",
    "\u201cThese people are the ones who are engaged in deals with the government. The deal is exposed when you count the number of security personal provided to them. We are MPS and are given only two security personnel whereas people like Mr. Abeywardene have been given at least six security personnel including SPs. Even former Minister Sagala Ratnayake has been given more security personnel than us though they are not MPs,\u201d he also said.",
    "Mr. Abeywardene who was referring to the decision made by government to provide an allowance of Rs. 5000 to chosen people for the New Year, said this amount is hardly sufficient when considering the cost of living. (Yohan Perera)"
