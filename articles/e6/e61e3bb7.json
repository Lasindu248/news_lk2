    "I\u2019m actually a humble, honest and a loyal person, fighting by myself to retain my won battles, and to achieve my dreams.",
    "2. If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?",
    "I would say trusting people, and if they break that trust, it does annoy me. I\u2019m not a hot tempered person, though, but can get angry, at times.",
    "3. If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?",
    "If that was possible, I would love to see my parents young again.",

    "The boat ride I had, in Nuwara-Eliya, on my birthday, last year \u2013 15th December, 2021. Enjoyed it thoroughly, and it was so exciting!",

    "Kind of, but I\u2019m not a fanatic. I love my Creator and I\u2019m so grateful to my Creator for making my life happy.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t say I am. I would say rather than luck, hard work makes things happen. It has happened to me on many occasions.",
    "Definitely, he has to be taller than me, (a six footer), I would say, educated, honest, loyal and a kind-hearted, understanding, humble human being. Yes, he needs to have a job as one cannot survive with this economy. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still to come across Mr. Right. Anyone out there (lol)!",
    "There is no such special person, where I\u2019m concerned, but if there is anyone who would support another, without expecting anything back in return, and giving his/her fullest support, and compassion, when it\u2019s needed, I would truly admire such a person.",
    "My Graduation images, Miss Sri Lanka images, and Miss Lumiere International World (International World pageant) images, are my treasure possessions.",

    "Someone who has experience in a desert island would be my ideal companion, or, perhaps someone who is living nearby that desert!",
    "Working in the corporate world and, especially with some superiors, who won\u2019t listen to what others have to say but always finding fault, without realising that it\u2019s their mistakes. And when they eventually do, the damage has already been done..",

    "You may not believe it, but I very much like the music of Mozart, and Hindi songs",
    "My work schedule doesn\u2019t give me much free time to listen to the radio, but if an opportunity does come my way, I would say the SLBC and Sun FM.",
    "Here again time, but I love watching the Oprah Winfrey show and also and the programmes featuring Ellen DeGeneres.",
    "Born in the same body, is fine with me, with the same beauty, same family, but wealthy, so that I can donate as much as I can to charity organisations which I cannot do so, as much I want to, now.",
    "I have done my MBA and now I\u2019m looking forward to do my DBA (Doctorate) and I need to work for a living, using my qualifications, while doing my passion in runways, as a runway model, when the time is right. And, like all other girls, I want to get married and have a good, healthy and happy family life.",
