    "Govt. trying to privatise health care under the guise of reviving economy: GMOA The government was trying to privatise the whole health sector, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has charged.",
    "While addressing the media, GMOA General Secretary Dr Senal Fernando said the health system was in a state of despair due to the economy and fuel crisis in the country.",
    "\"It is clear that the government is trying to privatise the health sector under the guise of reviving the economy. The health ministers in the current government and even in previous governments had conspiracies to destroy the health system in the country, \"Dr Fernando said.",
    "He said it was very clear that there was a conspiracy to privatise the free health system of these people.",
    "Therefore, the GMOA central committee, which gathered yesterday, decided to launch concerted trade union actions against any attempt by the government to privatise the health system under the guise of reviving the economy, Dr Fernando said.",
    "\"The government had deliberately collapsed the health system in the country,\" he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
