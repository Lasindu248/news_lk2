    "Seylan Bank\u2019s partnership with the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) for the \u2018Wild Kids\u2019 initiative, enabled a group of nature-loving children to engage in nature conservation activities in Colombo and Jaffna recently.In Colombo, over 50 children joined the \u2018Wetland Park Walk\u2019 at Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, where they toured the wetlands observing the trees, as well as animals and their behaviour in the wetland habitat. The children learnt about the eco-system of the wetland from specialized guides. They also participated in games, and were rewarded by Seylan Tikiri to appreciate and encourage the children to actively get involved in protecting the nature.",
    "Following this, the \u2018Nature through Art\u2019 \u2013 Art Workshop and Competition was conducted in Jaffna in partnership with Seylan Tikiri and Fox Resort. Three winners were selected and rewarded with Tikiri accounts and cash rewards, in addition to valuable gifts. They were also given a tour of Fox Resort including the art gallery and museum at the hotel. Seylan Bank\u2019s Area Manager for Jaffna, Nirmalan Nandakumar spoke to the children, emphasizing the importance of taking steps to saving the environment while saving for their future.",
    "As a financial institution, Seylan Tikiri encourages the habit of saving among children, teaching them to prepare for the future. As a socially responsible entity, the Bank with a Heart extends this encouragement to nature conservation, where the children also learn to save the planet earth. The two initiatives were part of a series of projects that the Bank conducts in partnership with WNPS.",
    "Speaking about these initiatives, Gamika De Silva, Assistant General Manager \u2013 Marketing and Sales, Seylan Bank stated, \u201cTwo main factors on which the future of our world lie on, are our children and nature. While paving the way to protect them both, it is also important that we develop a strong bond between the two. Seylan Tikiri always focuses on building a future generation who not only appreciates nature, but also gets actively involved in its conservation. Our partnership with WNPS has enabled us to carry out several projects in the past and we will continue to work with them in giving our Tikiri Kids an opportunity to bring out their talents.\u201d",
