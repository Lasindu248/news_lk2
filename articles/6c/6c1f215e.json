    "By unleashing change through bio-innovation, SLIBTEC expects to increase Sri Lanka\u2019s hi-tech exports by at least 1%.",
    "Following the signing of a Letter of Cooperation with USAID\u2019s PARTNER project, Treasury Secretary and Chairman of SLIBTEC S.R. Attygalle said: \u201cSLIBTEC Park and SLIBTEC Research Facility will open doors in Sri Lanka and internationally for multidisciplinary research and hi-end biotech development. This will facilitate and promote innovation in all spheres of biotechnology, including medical, agricultural, and industrial sectors. This will also usher in a new era for sustainability, as well as facilitate the creation of a more technologically advanced nation.\u201d",
    "To support the development of the park, the Finance Ministry worked closely with USAID to secure technical expertise through USAID\u2019s PARTNER project for the next two years.

    "\u201cAs one of Sri Lanka\u2019s longstanding development partners, USAID has provided development and humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka for over six decades, making substantial investments in almost every sector. Today, we are proud to extend our support to ensure the country\u2019s potential in biotechnology is pursued, promoted and developed,\u201d USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives Reed Aeschliman said.",
    "\u201cThe socio-economic impact of this investment to Sri Lanka will be significant as it creates jobs, increases innovation, and promotes entrepreneurship,\u201d he added. The SLIBTEC Biotechnology Innovation Park will be a 13.2-acre facility in Pitipana, Homogama that will house high-end biotechnology innovation and manufacturing firms.",
    "An on-site research facility will provide a centralised multidisciplinary research and service facility, with initial areas of research in Biopharma, Biofuel, Agro Biotech, and other emerging fields. The park will become a centre point of innovation in biotechnology in Sri Lanka and will attract investments and partnerships from local and international firms.",
    "SLIBTEC Ltd., was incorporated in October 2020 as a State-owned entity (www.slibtec.gov.lk). The Treasury is the sole shareholder and the Secretary to the Treasury is the SLIBTEC Chairman.",
    "USAID\u2019s PARTNER project is a $ 19 million, five-year initiative to facilitate trade and strengthen Government efficiency to fuel broad-based economic growth in support of the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s vision for economic development and improved international trade.",
