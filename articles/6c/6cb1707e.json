    "The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), in collaboration with the Free Media Movement (FMM), launched a trilingual research report entitled \u201cHuman Rights and Democracy, Threats to Journalists, HR Defenders and Civil Society 2022\u201d at an event at Hotel Janaki, 7 April.",
    "The report is a result of a six-month project which emphasises the necessity and importance of freedom of speech and expression, and the right to information through responsible journalism, and analyses 24 recent cases of threats to media freedom and human rights. The event was opened by CPA Senior Researcher Lionel Guruge who shared anecdotes and learnings from his life-long involvement in human rights activism as well as the objectives of the six-month project which was to reinforce human rights and democratic values through journalism.",
    "Other esteemed speakers included Attorney-at-Law and Senior Researcher Thusitha Siriwardena who presented the findings of the research report, Guest former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who shared the challenges that came with taking a stand and speaking the truth both in Parliament and elsewhere in Sri Lanka, while the rest of the speakers, who explored the social and legal ramifications of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (PTA) on journalism and human rights work as well as the importance of free speech and information in the current context, included Attorney-at-Law Lakshika Ratnayake, Media Expert Wijayananda Jayaweera, Centre for Policy Alternatives Executive Director Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Senior Lecturer in Sociology, Dr. M.T.M. Mahees and Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission Dr. M.H. Nimal Karunasiri.",
    "Project participants shared some of the case studies included in the report that they had obtained through 10 affiliated organisations as well as from significant cases documented by journalists. The launch of an innovative Whistle Blower App was also announced at the event, that allowed users to report and submit evidence anonymously and securely. Some of the two dozen major incidents and cases of threats to journalists, some of which were previewed in a 15-minute video documentary at the event, included the wrongful arrest of Shehan Malakala.",
    "The report details Shehan\u2019s ordeal with the authorities, being treated like a criminal for raising his voice against the Government for not providing justice to victims of the Easter attacks. Other case studies of journalists/activists who\u2019ve been subject to formal and legal measures taken to curtail their freedom of speech and publication include that of artist Sudantha Thilakasiri who was summoned by the CID in January 2020 to investigate a discussion program he was conducting on YouTube, and social activist Asha Dilrukshi Perera who was interrogated over a video that was shared on social media with an opinion against the Sri Lankan President.",
    "Common issues examined included the inflexible attitudes of information officers in some Government departments, and their tendency to collude with wrongdoers by exposing the identities of the journalists who seek information about various scams and illegal schemes. The report concluded with a number of recommendations to better ensure freedom of speech and thus right to information of citizens, including repeal of the PTA and proper application of the ICCPR.",
    "This event is part of a project supported by the British High Commission through its Magna Carta Fund, a strategic program fund dedicated to tackling the root causes of human rights violations globally.",
    "The trilingual report is available for download on the website of Sri Lanka\u2019s leading public policy research and advocacy think tank, Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) at https://www.cpalanka.org/human-rights-and-democracy-in-sri-lanka-book/."
