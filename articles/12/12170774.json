    "Meanwhile, a report on the real situation in the country regarding essential services and goods including fuel, electricity, gas, food commodities, fertilisers and medicines will be released to the public next Monday, the Premier said as it is better to reveal the truth to the people before giving solutions.",

    "He says he agrees with the sentiments of protesters demanding the resignation of his leader, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but says that will not happen.",
