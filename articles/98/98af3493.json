    "There is no restriction for importing medicines as they are not included in the non essential items that have been restricted by the Finance ministry a few days ago, Finance Ministry Secretary S. R. Attygalle said.",
    "A few days ago, a Gazette notification was issued restricting the imports of 367 non-essential items without a valid licence.",
    "However, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe yesterday said in Parliament that restricting the imports of 367 non-essential items without a valid licence was not a total ban and it was only a temporary measure."
