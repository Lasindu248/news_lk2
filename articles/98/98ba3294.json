  "body_lines": [
    "The United National Party (UNP) has urged the SriLankan Airlines to cancel the requests for proposal (RFPs) to lease new aircraft.",
    "In a statement issued today (April 15), the UNP said it is astounded to learn that the national carrier has released an Expression of Interest for the lease of aircraft for the airline.",
    "\u201cSriLankan Airlines has been classified as a loss-making enterprise by both the Committee on Public Enterprise (CoPE) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\u201d it read further.",
    "The UNP said any plans for expansion must be halted immediately and the Board of Directors must present an explanation to the Parliament regarding this decision, and noted that the government has announced that they will not be servicing the country\u2019s external debts.",
    "\u201cThis default by the government is an announcement to the global community that the country is now bankrupt,\u201d the UNP said, urging the government and the Board of Directors to explain to the public why they decided to take this decision despite the country facing a devalued currency and a default on our debt.",
    "\u201cFurthermore, the government is in negotiations with the Indian government over an additional Line of Credit to purchase essential food items and medicine,\u201d the statement read further.",
    "However, the irresponsible decision to seek the lease of a new aircraft for a loss-making airline will result in India questioning the practicality of providing Sri Lanka with further funding, the UNP pointed out."
