    "There will be no scheduled power cut on April 13, 14 and 15 on account of the up coming Sinhala and Tamil New year as well as Good Friday, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) chairman Janaka Ratnayaka said.",
    "Addressing the media, he said the PUCSL had planned not to impose power cuts during the festive season with the support of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).",
    "However, there will be a 2\u00bc hour power cut will be in place next weekend (April 16, 17).",
    "\"Fortunately, we have been able to trim the power outages over the weekend as the hydro catchment areas are receiving significant rainfall, which would enhance hydro power\u00a0 generation,\" Ratnayaka said.",
    "We have sufficient coal to operate thermal power plants and relevant payments have been made for another five shipments of coal with the support of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), he said.",
    "Meanwhile, the CPC is also getting sufficient supply of diesel to generate power. Also another shipload of furnace oil has already berthed into the country today.",
    "So, there won't be any issue with power generation and which in turn would help supply uninterrupted power to consumers, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
