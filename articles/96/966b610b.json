    "The failure to deliver on promises, defections and shortsighted decisions have led the country towards the edge of a precipice. Fuel shortages, soaring cost of living, irregular power outages and the fertiliser crisis have severely inconvenienced the public to the point that they have now opted to take to the streets to express their disappointment. Instability within the ruling party and the Opposition has further aggravated the situation as no political party is ready to come together with their rivals on the political stage to resolve the crisis before it worsens. On the contrary, each one of these parties has now started to campaign on its own with the hopes that it could overthrow the incumbent regime and resolve the crisis. But whether they are experienced enough to present a concrete, long-term plan to restore normalcy in the country remains glaringly doubtful.",

    "The crumbling of a hegemony",
    "",
    "Airing his views on the prevailing crisis political activist Dayapala Thiranagama said that the crisis will continue unchanged for some time. \u201cBasically the Rajapaksas\u2019 hegemonic power is crumbling and it will be difficult for them to build it up again. People are experiencing a difficult period and there\u2019s no political solution at all. From the power crisis to the fertiliser issue and fuel shortages, the problem that has been created cannot be resolved in the short term. Unless the Rajapaksas go out of this equation this crisis will remain,\u201d opined Thiranagama.",
    "",
    "Responding to a query on the split within the Opposition Thiranagama said that the people have no trust in the Opposition. \u201cThe Opposition has been unable to propose any creative programme to resolve the crisis,\u201d he said.",
    "Sometime back there had been talks about a Local Government Election, but Thiranagama said that any election at this point will bring a defeat to the Rajapaksa hegemony. \u201cThey have no way of winning an election unless and until they resolve the present crisis by bringing in fertilisers, restoring power and electricity and resolving other economic and political issues,\u201d he added.",
    "",
    "He further said that there cannot be an immediate solution unless the government admits that it has failed. \u201cAll political circles should unite and discuss these matters together. But I don\u2019t think they are in a situation to listen to people,\u201d said Thiranagama.",
    "",
    "Thiranagama warned that things would be catastrophic if the prevailing situation continues. \u201cPeople are unhappy. Things are bad for people and the government is unable to help. This won\u2019t be the last time that a defection happens in the government. It will happen again and again,\u201d he added.",

    "Experience matters",
    "",
    "\u201cGiven the nature of politics, it is unrealistic to expect a solution from parties that have brought about this ruin,\u201d opined Dr. Rajan Hoole, academic and human rights activist. \u201cMany of them may feel trapped themselves. It is also idle to expect some good men and women who have not been in politics at all to come up with a settlement that has no engine to give it life. To make anything work it needs people with political experience. A point worth thinking about is the 2018 constitutional crisis. People were for a time looking up to a Chief Justice who was seen to be honest and impartial. Such persons cannot do much by themselves. But activist groups could put more pressure on the courts. Judicial disasters like the Supreme Court\u2019s 1951 judgment in support of the Citizenship Act were not forcefully contested with a mixture of legal and political agitation. The Left simply threw in the towel. If the courts are prepared to declare bad laws unconstitutional as O.L. de Kretser did with Sinhala Only, that would help create a situation where democratic political agitation could succeed,\u201d opined Dr.Hoole.",
    "",
    "When asked if a Parliamentary election would be a remedy at this point Dr. Hoole responded in the negative. \u201cI don\u2019t think a parliamentary election within the next year would help. People need time to absorb what has happened and think about it. It is here that public discussion such as what we saw from 1993 - 1994 is important. There was a crisis, a hamstrung government and that gave space for free expression. Rushing for elections before the public has made up its mind would simply lead to anarchy,\u201d he said.",
    "",
    "As mentioned earlier a new regime might also be unable to resolve the prevailing crisis. \u201cA hamstrung government may not do much harm, but forcing change without consensus might do much damage,\u201d he further said.",
    "",
    "Regime change required?",
    "",
    "Ever since the incumbent Government assumed power one-sided decisions have become the order of the day.",
    "\u201cThis crisis is nothing new to Sri Lanka and everybody knew that it would blow out of proportion during the first quarter of 2022,\u201d opined senior political analyst Prof. Jayadeva Uyangoda. \u201cThe Government and the Opposition have proven that they are incapable of comprehending the gravity of the crisis. Therefore we cannot clearly see what would happen in weeks and months to come. Uncertainty has no solution. The economic crisis is unprecedented. The governance crisis is such that it requires a regime change. But even a new regime may not be able to handle the crisis. Maybe that\u2019s why the Samagi Jana Balawegaya is keeping quiet. Even if they come to power they cannot do it.",
    "",
    "\u201cWhat is required is an inclusive political discussion where the Government, trade unions, civil society groups and religious leaders would come together to discuss how to handle the crisis. This discussion shouldn\u2019t only be confined to the ruling party. Political bureaucrats and experts have proven that they\u2019re incapable of running a country,\u201d said Prof. Uyangoda.",
    "",
    "When asked about the possibility of having a Local Government Election, Prof. Uyangoda said that the Government might consider it an option to legitimise its failures. He further said that a regime change would give a sense of cathartic relief to people. \u201cPeople will realise that they have exercised their franchise by throwing out an inept, power hungry government. But if there\u2019s no unrest among people, then there\u2019s a serious problem with them,\u201d he affirmed.",

    "An ailing country",
    "",
    "\u201cSri Lanka is a country that has been governed in a disorderly manner for sometime now,\u201d observed senior political analyst and veteran journalist Victor Ivan. \u201cArrogance among leaders has led the country towards failure. The election of a president with indictments is questionable in the first place. The fact that there was no annexure to prove that he has given up his US citizenship was never questioned during the presidential election. In my opinion it was a massive fraud. People who questioned his citizenship were later labeled as LTTE supporters.",
    "\u201cThe President has put forward his military shadow and as a result those in his own party are afraid to question or advice him on how to put things on track. Even with a 100% majority no president has a right to govern a country according to his own whims and fancies. This country is now like an ailing patient who requires immediate surgery, but continues to be treated with native medicine. The impacts of the prevailing crisis will perhaps be felt for decades,\u201d said Ivan.",
    "",
    "He further said that it is rather unfortunate that there\u2019s no strong Opposition to propose a plan to rally all political parties together in order to resolve this crisis. \u201cIf people take to the streets, the Government will feel the pressure to some extent. It was good to see some women protesting in front of the President\u2019s house. More women should be involved in this resistance movement. The Sri Lankan economy depends on women as it is a majority of women in garment factories, estate sector and many other avenues who generate income to the country. Apart from that journalists too need to be critical at this point,\u201d he said.",

People have to be in queues and there\u2019s no electricity. The tourism industry is getting affected because small hotels don\u2019t have generators, the water board is not giving water and we are in a catastrophic situation.
