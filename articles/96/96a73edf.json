    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial banks have been ordered to double the share of remittances and mandatorily converted export proceeds surrendered to the central bank.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee has fallen from 203 to 285 after it was allowed more \u2018flexibility\u2019 in a bid to establish a float. The surrender rule comes as Indian credits are coming to finance imports.",
    "\u201c..[T]aking recent developments into consideration as well the need to further improve the foreign currency reserves of the country and to ensure the uninterrupted supply of essential imports,\u201d banks were directed to surrender more dollars, according to the circular.",
    "The central bank had earlier ordered exporters sell remaining export proceeds to commercial banks after allowing for expenses such as imported inputs, loan repayments and some investments in Sri Lanka Development Bonds.",
    "Analysts have warned that the surrender rule goes against the fall and tends to worsen downward pressure on the rupee. (Colombo/Mar23/2033)"
