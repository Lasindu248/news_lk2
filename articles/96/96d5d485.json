    "The British High Commission in Colombo recently commissioned a review to look at the impact of UK support to the Sri Lankan police to date, identify lessons learned and make recommendations with regards to future programmes, the British government said last Friday.",
    "It also said that the current project contract and CSSF programme cycle concluded on 31 March 2022.",
    "The British High Commission in Colombo is \u201cconsidering its approach to any future Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) programme and the review will be taken into account alongside a number of factors,\u201d Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) Vicky Ford said in a written answer to the UK Parliament recently.",
    "She also said that the UK Government is closely monitoring the political, economic and security situation in Sri Lanka. \u201cThe Minister for South Asia, Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon, has emphasised that violence against peaceful protestors is unacceptable. Those responsible for attacks should be held to account and fundamental rights must be protected,\u201d she stated.",
    "In last November, the Police Scotland has informed the UK High Commission in Sri Lanka that they will not extend their training contract with Sri Lanka\u2019s police force in March 2022, when it is set to expire, due to ongoing human rights concerns.",
    "However, last January, UK Foreign Office said that the Police Scotland\u2019s decision does not mean that there will be no future programme of UK-funded support to the Sri Lankan police.(Sunil Jayasiri)"
