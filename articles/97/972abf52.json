    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Power cuts of up to 10 hours in some areas in Sri Lanka on March30, Public Utilities Commission Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said as a flexible exchange regime created severe foreign exchange shortages and power deficits in the dry season.",
    "Areas ABCDEF and PQRS will have 10 hour continuous power cut from 2.00pm to 12.00am.",
    "Areas GHIJKL and TUVW will have 10 hour power cuts of 6 hours from 8.00am to 2.00pm and 4 hours and 30 minutes from 6.00pm to 10.00pm.",
    "Though the government has said power cuts will be reduced gradually, they have been extended mainly due to lack of fuel and higher demand as demand went up due to a lack of price increase.",
    "The lack of fuel also has resulted in large queues for diesel and petrol despite record price hikes. (Colombo/ March 29/2022)"
