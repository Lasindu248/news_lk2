    "Plan International, the global development and humanitarian organisation has been accused of misleading donors and abandoning some 20,000 children in Sri Lanka.",
    "The organisation shut its offices in Sri Lanka on December 12, 2019, despite signing a memorandum of understanding to initiate development work in the Uva province just months before.",
    "An internal review conducted by the Non Government Organisation (NGO) found that the Sri Lanka office was operating at high administrative costs, with little benefits going to the communities it intended to serve.",
    "High operating costs and worsening management-staff relationships in Sri Lanka were also identified as reasons for the abrupt exit.",
    "The Daily Mirror wrote to Plan International seeking comment on its sudden exit from Sri Lanka. In response, the organisation said that it is partnering with the NGO Secretariat to deliver handwashing facilities in 354 schools. However, the Director General of the NGO Secretariat Raja Gooneratne speaking to the Daily Mirror said that several issues were identified with the project.",
    "The Daily Mirror investigation into the exit found that many parties have complained to the NGO Secretariat of Sri Lanka, citing concerns that funds have been misused, adding that there was a possibility of the funds being used for the 2019 election campaigns.",
    "Meanwhile Plan's supporters have been critical of the organisation's operations, despite internal reviews and investigation into the sudden exit. (Kalani Kumarasinghe)"
