    "The \u2018Mee\u2019 tree has been selected for the program considering its contribution to pest control, ability to be used in the production of organic manure, ability to purify the air and its use as a natural medicine. Under this program, 75 Buddhist monks from various parts of the country and the people who visited the Umandawa premises were given \u2018Mee\u2019 saplings.",
    "Preventing deforestation and improving the natural removal of Carbon Dioxide from the air are main objectives of this program. Eventually this will bring many benefits such as minimizing greenhouse gases, better air purification, conservation of biodiversity in different parts of the country, increased production of organic manure and public awareness of the importance of conserving \u2018Mee\u2019 trees. The most significant feature of the program is SLT-MOBITEL using modern technology to monitor the growth of every tree planted, through the \u2018THURU\u2019 mobile application, which will greatly help determine the success of the program.",
