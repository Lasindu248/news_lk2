    "Main Opposition SJB Parliamentarian S.M. Marikkar yesterday emphasised that people have no faith in the current political system and have even lost faith in Parliament. He told journalists yesterday that people are tired of games and deals that have become commonplace in Sri Lanka\u2019s political culture and despite Parliament having met for three weeks since the onset of the crisis, its members have only been pointing fingers at each other as opposed to finding solutions.",
    "\u201cPeople don\u2019t care who said what and when. They have been hit with continuous problems and they are still in queues for food, gas, medicines and are unable to meet their monthly ends. Rather than discuss positions within an interim government with this corrupt regime, we need to find urgent solutions to the problems faced by people. We need to convene an urgent international donor convention to find means to provide solutions to people over the next two years,\u201d Marikkar said.",
    "The SJB MP said he has little faith in the President\u2019s call for an interim Government due to the continuous see-sawing of positions. Despite reportedly agreeing with proposals put forth by various stakeholders, Marikkar questioned if this was a ploy by the executive and his party to buy time until the 5 March 2023, whereby the President has authority to dissolve parliament."
