    "Launches distribution channel expansion with \u2018SIS\u2019 and \u2018CIDO\u2019 outlets to drive premiumisation and enhance customer, dealer experience",
    "CEAT Kelani Holdings has begun the rollout of two new retail concepts in Sri Lanka for the CEAT brand.",
    "Part of a three-year distribution channel expansion strategy designed to drive brand exclusivity and premiumisation and enhance customer experience at partner outlets in tandem with product improvements, these new retail concepts are branded \u2018Shop in Shop\u2019 (SIS) and \u2018Company Invested Dealer Operated\u2019 (CIDO) business models, the company said. They were developed in consultation with CEAT India, and shadow the CEAT \u2018Shoppe\u2019 retail concept already launched in the subcontinent.",
    "The CEAT Shop in Shop concept entails demarcating a dedicated area for CEAT branded tyres within existing multi-brand dealer premises. CEAT will furnish the floor, customer lobby and reception areas of this private space to augment customer comfort.",
    "Additionally, the company will also invest in interior branding, signage, and innovative product display racks to emphasise the tyre offerings available with the channel partner. Besides enhancing the visibility and positioning of the brand, this model will also increase the channel partners\u2019 share of wallet, the company said.",
    "CEAT has already launched two SIS retail outfits in Colombo and plans to complete four more before the close of 2023.",
    "The Company Invested Dealer Operated or CIDO outlets are essentially CEAT flagship stores established around the island to create an exclusive space for the brand. CEAT CIDOs are designed to significantly enhance brand visibility, customer engagement, and crucially, the customer experience. As the name suggests, CEAT will invest in these outlets by providing tyre changing equipment in addition to the branding suite, the furniture, and fixtures for these outlets.",
    "Managing Director Ravi Dadlani said: \u201cCEAT\u2019s emergence as the top brand in Sri Lanka\u2019s tyre sector is the result of substantial investments over several years that have seen not just exponential increases in volumes but expansion of the product range, the deployment of new technology and quantum improvements in quality.",
    "\u201cIt is therefore important that the visibility of the brand at the retail end as well as the customer experience, keep pace with, and do justice to, the brand\u2019s growth. The SIS and CIDO concepts are part of that process.\u201d",
    "The manufacturer of half of the Sri Lanka\u2019s pneumatic tyre requirements, CEAT Kelani Holdings is considered one of the most successful India \u2013 Sri Lanka joint ventures. The joint venture\u2019s cumulative investment in Sri Lanka to date exceeds Rs. 8 billion, and another Rs. 3.2 billion has been committed in 2022 for expansion of volumes, technology upgrades and new product development.",
    "The company\u2019s manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka encompass tyres in the radial (passenger cars, vans, and SUVs), commercial (nylon and radial), motorcycle, three-wheeler, and agricultural vehicle segments.",
    "The CEAT brand accounts for market shares in Sri Lanka of 48% in the Radial segment, 80% in the Truck category, 84% Light Truck tyre category, 51% in the Three-Wheeler tyre segment, 36% in the Motorcycle tyre segment and 72% in the Agricultural vehicle tyre category. CEAT Kelani exports about 20% of its production to 16 countries in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Far East."
