    "Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa is likely to lose his portfolio in the event of the formation of an interim administration with a new Cabinet, Daily Mirror learns.",
    "In a statement, the BASL observed that social media is a vital aspect of the freedom of expression of the people as important as the traditional media such as radio, television, and the print media. The BASL maintained that the ban on social media is the modern-day equivalent of closing down a television channel or a newspaper.",
    "\u201cThis ban has clearly been imposed to thwart the fundamental right of the people of Sri Lanka the freedom of expression including speech and publication which is unacceptable. The ban also has the effect of stifling the thought process of the people which is protected under Article 10 of the Constitution which guarantees to the people the freedom of thought, conscience and religion which is not restricted by any provision of the Constitution,\u201d BASL statement added.",
    "The BASL further observed that even members of the Cabinet of Ministers have expressed their views against the ban. The BASL reiterated that Supreme Court in the recent case of U.N.S.P. Kurukulasuriya, Convenor, Free Media Movement, and J. K.W. Jayasekara, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation has upheld the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article14 (1) (a).",
    "This statement had been issued under the signatures of BASL President Saliya Pieris PC and its newly appointed Secretary Isuru Balapatabendi. (KELUM BANDARA)"
