    "COLOMBO; Russian forces must be pushed out of \u201cthe whole of Ukraine\u201d, the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said.",
    "In a keynote speech in London, Truss said the victory for Ukraine was now a \u201cstrategic imperative\u201d for the West.",
    "This amounts to the clearest statement yet of Britain\u2019s war aims which have, until now, been limited to stating that President Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u201cmust fail and be seen to fail\u201d.",
    "She said Western allies must \u201cdouble down\u201d in their support for Ukraine.",
    "\u201cWe will keep going further and faster,\u201d Truss said, \u201cto push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine.\u201d",
    "This implies that Russian forces must leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks since their invasion on 24 February but also those areas they invaded and annexed eight years ago, such as Crimea in the south and parts of the eastern Donbas region.",
    "A month into this latest invasion, Russia declared its main goal was the \u201cliberation of Donbas\u201d \u2013 broadly referring to Ukraine\u2019s regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.",
    "More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian proxy forces in a war that began in 2014.",
    "Not all western powers may share Truss\u2019 ambitious target, fearing it is unlikely to be achieved either by arms or negotiation.",
    "Some French and German officials have been more cautious about stating war aims that risk provoking Russia, preferring to focus instead on language about defending Ukraine.",
    "The foreign secretary\u2019s latest remarks in a speech at Mansion House in London reflect the desire by some in the West to aim high, so that Ukraine enters any possible future talks about a political settlement to the conflict with the best negotiating hand possible.",
    "Truss also used her speech to make clear the West should do more to deter future Russian aggression.",
    "This, she said, should include more spending on defending itself, with the Nato target of spending 2% of national output on defence seen as \u201ca floor not a ceiling\u201d.",
    "She also said Western powers should use their \u201ceconomic heft\u201d to exclude Russia from western markets.",
    "\u201cAccess to the global economy must depend on playing by the rules,\u201d she said.",
    "But Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said earlier on Wednesday that the speech \u201cappears to be an admission of failure after more than a decade of decline\u201d in the government\u2019s commitment to defence and security.",
    "Truss also set out her view that the West should send weapons to other countries threatened by Russia.",
    "\u201cWe must ensure that, alongside Ukraine, the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom.\u201d",
    "She added that if Sweden or Finland chose to join Nato, \u201cwe must integrate them as soon as possible\u201d.",
    "She said: \u201cThe war in Ukraine is our war \u2013 it is everyone\u2019s war\u2026 because Ukraine\u2019s victory is a strategic imperative for all of us.",
    "\u201cHeavy weapons, tanks, airplanes \u2013 digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe cannot be complacent \u2013 the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let\u2019s be clear \u2013 if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe.",
    "Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin warned earlier on Wednesday that any country meddling in Ukraine would be met with a \u201clightning\u201d fast response.",
    "\u201cWe have all the tools [to respond] that no one can boast of,\u201d he told Russian lawmakers. \u201cAnd we will not be bragging about them, we will use them if necessary.\u201d",
    "Ministers facing issues due to absence of gazette on their functions",
    "President to chair meeting with SLPP MPs; Independents to meet Sirisena"
