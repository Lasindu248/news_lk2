    "\u201cWe will concentrate on a five pronged approach that is the abolition of the executive presidency, the repealing of the 20th draconian amendment which centralized power with the executive president, brining back the 19th Amendment which comprised of good governance principles, we will ensure that we embark on a no-confidence motion, impeachment motion, and explore the possibilities of cutting off funding for the President,\u201d he told Bloomberg on Monday (18).",

    "Sri Lanka is seeking up to $4 billion this year to help it import essentials and pay creditors amid a downward economic spiral of dwindling foreign reserves and Asia\u2019s fastest inflation.",
