    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Billionaire Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter for about US$41 billion in cash, saying the social media company he has often criticized needs to go private to see effective changes.",
    "Musk\u2019s offer price of US$54.20 per share, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday (14), represents a 38%\u00a0 premium to Twitter\u2019s April 1st close, the last trading day before the Tesla CEO\u2019s more than 9% stake in the company was made public.",
    "The total deal value was calculated based on 763.58 million shares outstanding, according to Refinitiv data.",
    "Musk rejected an offer to join Twitter\u2019s board earlier this week after disclosing his stake in the company, a move which analysts said signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15 per cent.",
    "\u201cSince making my investment I now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,\u201d Musk said in a letter to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor.",
    "\u201cMy offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,\u201d Musk stated. \u201cTwitter has extraordinary potential. \u00a0I will unlock it,\u201d he further added.",
