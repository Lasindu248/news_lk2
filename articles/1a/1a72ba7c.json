  "title": "OPA hands over proposals on addressing agriculture, food production crisis to Agriculture Ministry",
  "body_lines": [
    "The OPA delegation (from left): Treasurer Bandula Gamarachchi, OPA Land and Agriculture Standing Committee Chairman Sarath Jayatilaka, President Dulitha Perera, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, General Secretary Upali Jayawardena, and OPA President Elect Ruchira Gunasekera",
    "An OPA delegation led by President Dulitha Perera and comprising OPA Land and Agriculture Standing Committee Chairman Sarath Jayatilaka and other office bearers submitted its short-term recommendations to Government for urgent attention and immediate implementation.",
    "The ill-fated decision in April 2021, caused drastic disruptions over agriculture export earnings, especially affecting the tea industry, further aggravating the foreign exchange crisis. Over 40% of crop yield declined, especially of paddy, leading to the present crisis of shortages and price hikes at unaffordable levels.",
    "The Government must not resort to any more imports of essential food items including rice, where quality is not assured. OPA stresses that immediate implementation of its proposals would lead to arrest further aggravation of the current food production crisis in the country and help recover the hampered livelihoods of the farming communities.",
    "The proposals included, that measures be taken to re-activate the medium and long-term programs implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Department of Animal Production and health, Department of Agrarian Development, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, and the Provincial Departments of Agriculture and Animal production and Health, and private sector agencies, that focused on building a sustainable agriculture system leading to a food secured Sri Lanka.",
    "Likewise, OPA proposals also called for immediate interventions to address requirements arising at soil preparation, sowing, manuring, irrigation, weeding, harvesting, storage, and access to market needs.",

    "\u2022Develop a mechanism to promote and commercialise local technologies and innovations with the recommendation of the mandated State institutions through scientific research",
    "\u2022Measures must be taken to popularise and expand Good Agriculture Practices (GAP)-certification program at the National level",
