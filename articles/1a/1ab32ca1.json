    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic and foreign creditors who can apply to receive suspended debt repayments in rupees under an interim policy, could also be paid in bonds as an alternative, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "Under Sri Lanka\u2019s debt suspension policy, interest and principle payments will be capitalized at the applicable interest rate until a restructuring arrangement is finalized. The Finance Ministry has also offered to issue a new debt instrument to those who ask.",
    "In the interim period until re-structuring holders of debt could opt to receive the \u201cSri Lankan rupee equivalent of an mount falling due during the interim period in lieu of the capitalization,\u201d according to the debt policy.",
    "\u201cAny external creditor or a domestic holder of ISBs \u2013 those will be under re-structuring anyway \u2013 if the domestic one or foreign investor want rupees, we said there is an option,\u201d Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201cFor example if a foreign investor wants to collect rupees and invest in the stock market there is an option.\u201d",
    "Out of 13,050 million dollars of international sovereign bonds outstanding at the end of 2021, 1,859 million was held by domestic holders. In a 500 million dollar bond that was repaid in early 2022 about 117 million was estimated to have been held domestically.",
    "\u201cThis is also a request coming from the domestic banking sector as well,\u201d the Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201cThere are some domestic banks who have invested in the secondary market, this is a more appropriate option for them. At that time they can take rupee at the value of the prevailing exchange rate.\u201d",
    "The debt policy said the payments would be paid in rupees as long as it was \u2018feasible under the relevant credit documentation\u201dand was \u201cconsistent with the central bank\u2019s monetary policy.\u201d",
    "If large amounts of money are paid out by overdrawing commercial banks (which leads to a reserve short which is are then filled with central bank re-finance) or direct central bank credit, the new liqudity can further destabilize the exchange rate.",
    "\u201cThe option is for the government to give in rupees,\u201d Weerasinghe said. \u201cThe government can transfer funds in cash or the government can give in rupees. That has not been decided. That is something we have to consider at that point.",
    "\u201cFirst we will have to see whether there are holders of ISBs who are willing to take that option. If they are willing to then the next consideration is whether the government can transfer the funds immediately or give a bond. That is something that can be considered later.\u201d",
    "Creditors who wish to receive rupees have to inform the Finance Ministry within one month of the defaulted payment. (Colombo/May01/2022)"
