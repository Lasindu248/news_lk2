    "\u201cDistracting people won\u2019t change the facts. India looks a lot like Sri Lanka,\u201d he said.",
    "Congress has been accusing the BJP government of distracting people with other issues to hide its failures and issues of price rise and unemployment.",
    "The grand old party has also been attacking the central government over the issue of price and inflation and rising unemployment and has said that the situation in India is going the Sri Lanka way, where the prime minister had to resign in view of the deteriorating situation.",
    "Meanwhile, India\u2019s wholesale price-based inflation soared to a record high of 15.08 per cent in April mainly on account of spiraling prices of food, fuel and other commodities. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) at 15.08 per cent is the highest in the new series. The WPI inflation has remained in double digits for the 13th consecutive month since April last year.",
