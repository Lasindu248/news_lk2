  "title": "Sri Lanka\u2019s CEB asked to increase diesel, hydro power after coal plant outage",
  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s power regulator has ordered Ceylon Electricity Board to generate more power from diesel and hydro to make up for a coal plant which will be out of commission for at least five days.",
    "\u201cThe commission advises you to increase the Hydro & Thermal Generation to cater the demand without increasing the existing power shedding duration (3 hours and 20 minutes per day) until the Lakvijaya Unit 1 resumes generation,\u201d the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka has said.",
    "\u201cYou are also informed to let the commission know if there is any concern in implementation of above.\u201d",
    "On May 03, where there were no power cuts the CEB generated 48 GigaWatts of power, with coal down from the usual 19 GWh to about 13.1.",
    "Sri Lanka coal power plants at breakdown risk without spare parts",
    "CEB engineers had warned earlier that scheduled maintenance of the three coal plants were delayed and routine maintenance was also becoming difficult due to lack of foreign exchange for spares and service contracts.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing severe foreign exchange shortages after the rupee collapsed steeply after economists in the country money printed to keep interest rates artificially low and boost growth, worsening anchor conflicts of an inherently unstable intermediate regime. (Colombo/May04/2022)"
