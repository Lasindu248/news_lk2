    "\u201cIt is too early to say,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said in response to a question whether Sri Lanka could quality for 535 percent of quota exceptional access at peak program from the IMF.",
    "\u201cThey have to assess the external financing gap. In 2009 we got 400-pct of quota. I do not see why we cannot get at least that amount.",
    "\u201cNow the financial gap is much, much higher than what we had at that time.\u201d",
    "A 400 percent of quota program would put Sri Lanka\u2019s next program at around 3.0 billion US dollars.",
    "Governor Weerasinghe said an EFF may be the \u201cmost relevant\u201d given the structural reforms needed.",
    "Sri Lanka is to begin formal talks with the IMF from April 18 when a delegation visits Washington to take part in annual IMF-World Bank meetings.",
    "Finance Minister Ali Sabry has said a billion dollars each may be disbursed over three years under Sri Lanka\u2019s next IMF program.",
    "By 2025 Sri Lanka\u2019s IMF loans would fall to around 60 percent of quota, allowing a drawdown of around 470 percent of quota at peak, in a 535 percent access program.",
    "A recent program for Argentina, the archetypal soft-pegged defaulter, got 1200 percent quota access.",
    "Analysts have speculated that a front loaded Stand-by or an EFF may be assigned to Sri Lanka and have suggested that given the monetary instability that had come from flexible-inflation-targeting-with-a-peg in the past a reserve money program should be followed.",
    "Under a reserve money program, complementary targets such as a floor on the central bank\u2019s Treasury bills stock and foreign reserves can be programmed, the rupee easily stabilized, provided interest rates are not rigidly enforced with open market operations.",
    "Concerns have been raised that a monetary policy consultation clause in the last program compatible FIT-with-a-peg had led to external instability and missed reserve targets and excessive foreign borrowing once forex shortages emerged as in 2018.",
    "However Governor Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka will stick with the (flexible) inflation targeting arrangement that has been used in the recent past. (Colombo/Apr15/2022)"
