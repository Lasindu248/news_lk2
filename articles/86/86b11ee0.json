    "Elaborating on this service, Amit Kumar Parija, CEO, Whiteklay Pte Ltd said, \u201cThe true value of data science will be realized only when you have a good data engineering stack. In today\u2019s world, not having a strong data background should not be a deterrent for any organisation to get some quick insights from data. If a trend line can be spotted in the data, analysts should be able to ask the system as to \u2018what changed?\u2019 giving them the flexibility to slice and dice on the data at a real-time level and generate a dashboard as per their liking. If they don\u2019t need the dashboard after a few days, they can discard or edit the same. But the fact is, deploying such systems inside any organisation\u2019s environment takes a big effort from technology, strategy and finance teams. If the tech team isn\u2019t that strong, then setting up the system and acquiring skills to manage and run the system takes a big pie out of the budget as well as time. This is where a lot of companies are looking to engage on getting \u2018data exploration as a service\u2019- hassle free big data exchange platform enabled at the click of a button.\u201d",
