    "British Conservative party politician Lord Michael Naseby said redactions in the secret dispatches sent to the British government during the civil war in Sri Lanka must be removed to get a clearer picture of the events that unfolded during the conflict.",
    "Lord Naseby was referring to the controversial dispatches sent by the UK's defense attach\u00e9 to the British High Commission in Colombo from 2007 to 2009. The reports were classified as \u2018secret\u2019 by the British government until it was challenged by Naseby citing the UK\u2019s Freedom of Information Act.",
    "\"There were huge redactions in there. I say today to you publicly, that I'm not satisfied with those redactions. I've reflected on it for some time now. I'm going to try and get those redactions lifted, one way or the other,\" Naseby said.",
