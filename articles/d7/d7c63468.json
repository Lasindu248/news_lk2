    "Heads of key missions to Sri Lanka, including the members of the EU, US and Japan on Friday called on Sri Lanka to join them in \u2018vocal support\u2019 for Ukraine and international law, including the UN Charter and also urged Sri Lanka to join them in calling on Russia to end its hostilities immediately.",
    "\u201cWe will work together with our friends and allies around the world to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored. We stand with Ukraine; and for freedom, democracy, and the sovereignty of nations around the world,\u201d a joint statement stated.",
    "The statement was issued by the head of the delegation of the European Union, high commissioners of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the ambassadors of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Rumania, Switzerland and the United States.",
    "The envoys condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as an unprovoked, unjust and illegal attack on a peaceful, democratic and sovereign state.",
    "\u201cThis outrageous attack is a gross violation of international law, including the UN charter.\u201d The statement also charged Russia for dramatically escalating its attacks on civilian neighbourhoods and infrastructure, leading to large numbers of civilian casualties. Millions of ordinary civilians - mainly women, children and older persons - have been forced to flee from their homes into neighbouring countries as refugees, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the last 70 years, it read further."
