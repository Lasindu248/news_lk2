    "The former state minister made this statement while addressing the CWC\u2019s May Day rally today (01).",
    "He said that there is no need for him to hold office in the present government which has caused so much suffering to the people.",
    "The MP further stated that the Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress has decided to withdraw its support to the government due to this.",
    "He added: \u201cWhen any government comes to power, we are always given the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure or the Ministry of Livestock. Can\u2019t we be the Minister of Education? Is the Ministry of Defense not suitable for us? Why can\u2019t we be the Prime Minister of this country?\u201d",
    "\u201cToday, some politicians in our estate areas ask what positions we will be given if we support the formation of a government. They work looking for positions. The Ceylon Workers\u2019 Congress is not a party that works for positions.\u201d",
