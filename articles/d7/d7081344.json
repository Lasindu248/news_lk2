    "The wholesale shops in Pettah were deserted today resulted in poor business turnover. The shop owners lament that it is difficult to trade essential commodities because of skyrocketing prices and price control mechanism. However the porters (natamis) seem busy loading and unloading goods to and from Lorries. Pix by Nimalsiri Edirisinghe\u00a0 and Nisal Baduge."
