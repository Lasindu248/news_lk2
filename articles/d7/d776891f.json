    "COLOMBO (News 1st); New Zealand has revised its travel advisory for Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cWe are now advising New Zealanders against undertaking non-essential travel to Sri Lanka due to recent civil unrest and the economic crisis in the country,\u201d tweeted New Zealand High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Michael Appleton on Wednesday (11).",
    "Official advice for New Zealanders living and travelling overseas :",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation has deteriorated significantly in recent months. This has led to shortages of such basic necessities as fuel and certain food products, causing long queues in a range of shops, including supermarkets, petrol stations and pharmacies. Fuel shortages make all forms of transport around Sri Lanka, including trains, buses, and cars, less reliable. Local authorities have imposed rationing of electricity, which has resulted in lengthy power outages.",
    "There are ongoing large protests, demonstrations and political rallies relating to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and political crisis. There have also been multiple incidents of violent clashes in public places around Sri Lanka, resulting in a number of deaths and hospitalisations \u2013 as well as destruction of property, including the burning of houses. Police have used tear gas and water cannons to disperse certain demonstrations and violent situations, and authorities have imposed states of emergency and curfews at short notice. Further political demonstrations, violent clashes and curfews are likely.",
    "We advise New Zealanders in Sri Lanka to avoid protests, demonstrations, rallies and large crowds as they have the potential to turn violent with little warning. Comply with any instructions issued by the local authorities, including any curfews. Monitor local and international media, review personal security plans and be aware of your surroundings. If unexpectedly in the vicinity of a protest, demonstration or violent clashes, exercise caution and leave the area quickly.",
    "New Zealanders are advised to carry photo identification, or a photocopy of their passport, with them at all times and produce this if asked by authorities.",
    "New Zealanders travelling or living in Sri Lanka should have a comprehensive travel insurance policy in place that includes provision for medical evacuation by air.",
    "New Zealanders in Sri Lanka are encouraged to register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.",
