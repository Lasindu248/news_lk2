    "SJB Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha De Silva said today he was ready to accept the Ministry of Finance if a national government was formed with the participation of all political parties representing Parliament.",
    "He said even if he accepted the Finance Ministry portfolio, the problem of the country would not be resolved and pointed out that all political parties must work in tandem for that.",
    "\u201cIt will be a personal victory for me if I accept the Finance Minister post. But, it is not a victory for the country. If I am to accept the Finance Ministry, I must accept it under a national government. I am 100 percent ready to dedicate myself for the country. There should be a national government for that. Being independent and joining the government is not what is called a national government. All political parties such as SLPP, SJB, TNA and JVP must get together. Why can\u2019t we do that for a national requirement?,\u201d he asked.",
    "Dr. De Silva said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa should clearly state the time frame to bring in the Constitutional Amendment to scrap executive presidency as suggested by the SJB. \u201cWe are not urging him to do it overnight. He can give a time frame to do that. The ball is in the President\u2019s court now. It is his turn to play,\u201d he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
