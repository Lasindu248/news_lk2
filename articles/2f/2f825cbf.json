    "Three channels owned by the Indian multinational Star Sports network have not been on air on Peo TV from Monday (28) due to payment difficulties, a Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) official told Economy Next on Thursday (31).",
    "SLT is Sri Lanka\u2019s national telecommunications provider, with the government owning 50.5 percent of the company.",
    "\u201cA few channels aren\u2019t being aired because we are unable to make some of the payments. However, we are working with the bank to get this problem solved. It will most likely be resolved by today or tomorrow,\u201d the official said.",
    "There are issues with remitting payments and restrictions revolving around payments and that is the only barrier in providing the service to consumers, the official said.",
