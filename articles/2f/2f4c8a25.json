    "Rohan is now based in Los Angeles, California, in the States, and is still busy as a musician.",

    "Nihan operates as MENDIS (his stage name) and is a producer and performer, based in Los Angeles.",
    "He moves into action at the top hip-hop clubs in LA, in addition to being an Independent producer, and writer/performer, under his own label MENDIS.",
    "His performance, last December, at the renowned \u2018Catch One\u2019 hip-hop club got him 5-star reviews.",
    "He\u2019s also booked for various events throughout the upcoming months.",
    "Says dad, Rohan: \u201cHe\u2019s a very independent individual. I do not get involved in his creativity as it will influence his free thinking and very capable talents.\u201d",
    "Rohan goes on to say that he only trained him, and his elder brother, Shehan (a guitar player), when they were very young.",
    "Nihan was involved in the song, \u2018Poor in America,\u2019 three years ago, as co-lyrist and performer.",
