  "title": "Sri Lanka economic crisis: former PM wants national consensus, not change in govt",
  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Changing governments or forming a national government is not the need of the hour and Sri Lanka\u2019s political parties must instead work on building a national consensus towards a permanent solution to the country\u2019s economic woes, former prime minister and sole MP of the opposition United National Party (UNP) Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently going through one of the worst financial crises in the country\u2019s history, with dwindling foreign exchange reserves severely impacting essential imports. There has been speculation in the media that the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), its popularity fast eroding, is looking to offer the premiership to Wickremesighe \u2013 a rumour that both the UNP leader and incumbent prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa have denied.",
    "Speaking at a UNP event in Colombo Sunday (13) evening, Wickremesinghe said all parties that represent parliament must agree on an ironclad economic framework to help the country out of its present crisis.",
    "\u201cThere must be a national consensus on how to overcome this. It\u2019s not a national government that\u2019s needed. There\u2019s no point of one, and people will say we\u2019re just dividing up the cabinet portfolios among ourselves. What\u2019s needed here is a national consensus,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe opposition can remain in the opposition, and government members can remain in the government. But they must all arrive at a national agreement on solving this problem \u2013 an agreement that\u2019s valid not just for one year but for 15 or 20 years,\u201d he added.",
    "Once consensus has been reached, the former prime minister said, the government and opposition can discuss elections and even the possibility of early elections.",
    "\u201cBut the national framework and basic policies cannot be changed,\u201d he said.",
    "Successive governments playing politics and routinely changing what should\u2019ve been national policies have resulted in the present crisis, said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cSince the country was developed in 1977 and a middle class was established, we have now again fallen to this place. We have to save it. Whether we\u2019re in government or opposition, we in the UNP must always work towards it,\u201d he said.",
    "The UNP leader warned that if Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t find a way out soon, the country may end up like Greece.",
    "\u201cWe must solve this problem. The government took too much time.",
    "\u201cNow there is also a conflict between the finance minister and the central bank governor. These issues must be resolved by the government,[before they] end up in the media,\u201d he said.",
    "IMF top team in Sri Lanka to brief President on economic crisis",
    "Wickremesinghe further said the UNP expects to study the IMF report on Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation once it is presented to parliament before an all party conference next week.",
    "\u201cThe people must know the gravity of the situation. The government can\u2019t hide that. They must communicate it. The opposition must also be informed and act on it,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow is not the time to change governments. Now is the time to solve this present crisis, or we won\u2019t have a country left in the next few months.",
    "\u201cNo matter what our politics, this is our country. We must save it,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar14/2022)"
