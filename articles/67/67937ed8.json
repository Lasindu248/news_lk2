    "In light of World Environment Day, the all-new Eko Plasco Material Recovery Facility (MRF) was launched by Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd (CCBSL) and Eco Spindles Pvt Ltd on the 8th of June 2022 in Wadduwa. The facility was opened under the auspices of Chief Guest Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment. The MRF was introduced to support waste management, and to give back meaningful life to plastic waste through recycling, whilst helping to create awareness on responsible plastic disposal.",
    "A MRF is a solid waste management facility that processes recyclable materials such as PET plastic and sells them to manufacturers as raw materials for the creation of new products. Plastic waste is collected via a wide bin and bag collection network, and then sent to the MRF where it is segregated and processed through machinery such as balers and crushers. The baler compresses the plastic into compact bales, which makes it easier to store and transport, while the crusher machine crushes the plastic into granules adding value to the waste prior to it being sold to recyclers.",
    "Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment commented: \u201cI am happy to see private sector organisations such as Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka & Eco Spindles contribute significantly to the waste management infrastructure in Sri Lanka. Initiatives like the Eko Plasco MRF are of paramount importance as they complement the upcoming national voluntary Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiative by the Government of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Mayank Arora, Managing Director, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka noted: \u201cThe Eko Plasco facility was opened as part of our \u2018Give Back Life\u2019 programme which is line with the company\u2019s global commitment towards a \u2018World Without Waste\u2019 with a goal to Collect and Recycle an equivalent of every bottle sold by Coca-Cola by 2030.\u201d",
