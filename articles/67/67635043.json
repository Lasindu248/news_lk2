    "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) United Trade Union Alliance has decided to call off the proposed island-wide strike today, Trade Union Alliance Convener Ranjan Jayalal said.",
    "He said the decision was taken following a discussion with the President last night.",
    "However, several areas in the county experienced power cuts this morning.",
    "Accordingly, several districts namely, Kandy, Kegalle, Hambantota, Colombo and Anuradhapura areas, suffered power cuts.",
    "The power cuts will be restored in two or three hours and technical personnel have been assigned in restoration duties.",
    "The countrywide strike\u00a0 was launched last night after discussions ended in a stalemate with the Power and Energy Minister over the amendment to the Electricity Act, which would clear the path for Adani Group\u2019s proposal for the 500MW Wind Power Project in Mannar and Pooneryn to materialize without following the due process.",
    "The decision to call off the strike was made only as a temporary measure, considering the inconvenience to the people. If the amendment is passed in Parliament today, we will not hesitate to resume our trade union action with immediate effect. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
