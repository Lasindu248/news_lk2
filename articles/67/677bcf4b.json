    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s is slashing a surrender rule requiring banks to sell export remittances to the monetary authority newly created money to 25 percent from 50 percent, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.",
    "\u201cThe surrender rule is reduced to 25 percent, from 50 percent,\u201d Governor Weerasinghe said.",
    "Commercial banks are required to sell to the central bank 50 percent of dollars they receive from exporters and remittances.",
    "Analysts had blamed the surrender rule and low policy rates for the failure of an attempt to float the currency in March. The rupee fell from 203 to 330 and remains non-credible peg with forex shortages.",
    "A float would instantly match inflows to imports (by fixing reserve money and limiting reserve money changes to cash draw downs and deposits in banks and any open market operations conducted to maintain the policy rate.",
    "However a surrender rule expands reserve money through dollar purchases, pushing the currency down, and also reduces it through any dollars given for imports, making it a peg and preventing a free float from being established.",
    "Weerasinghe had hiked policy rates to 14.50 percent which will reduce credit and also put the brakes on reserve money expansion and eventually domestic credit, which drive imports. (Colombo/Apr12/2022)"
