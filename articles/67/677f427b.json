    "While expressing that the government was concerned on the arrest of journalists during yesterday's protest in Mirihana, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said today appropriate action would be taken on the matter.",
    "The Minister told the news conference at the Presidential Media Centre that such arrests could happen when a mob behaving violently.",
    "\"When a mob turn violent,security personnel cannot practically check everyone. Anyone could carry a card and move around. I am not justifying the arrests. It shouldn't have happened as far as journalists are concerned. Unfortunately, it happened. We will ensure that media personnel's rights are ensured,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
