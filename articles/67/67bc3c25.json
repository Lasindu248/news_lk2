    "MP Dr. Harsha De Silva said that Sri Lanka will have to wait until the end of this year to obtain a loan from International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
    "Even though staff level meetings are underway it\u2019s monetary board has to approve the loan.",
    "\"When I had a discussion with the Japanese Ambassador he said that they have lost their trust in Sri Lanka. They said that they could consider giving a short term loan if there\u2019s an all-party government or else both the Opposition and the government should sign the loan agreement,\" he said.",
    "\"I then met former Maldivian President Nasheed and he said that Sri Lanka has given him a contract to bring in some dollars. He had spoken to Mohammed Bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. But he has said that Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t even have a plan to obtain financial assistance. He has then spoken to the ruler of United Arab Emirates who has requested Nasheed to send a list of things that Sri Lanka is willing to sell and that he would consider providing financial assistance.This shows that Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t even have a representative to talk to MBS,\" he added."
