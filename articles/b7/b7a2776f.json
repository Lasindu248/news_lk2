    "\u201cThere is no point in planning if we don\u2019t get support from the parliament,\u201d Wijesekera told the parliament.",
    "\u201cWhether it is you or we, whoever is the subject minister, there had been policy plans. But there had been barriers from trade unions to not implement them.\u201d",
    "The minister\u2019s comments come after the CEB Engineering trade unions opposed some amendments to the CEB Act that was debated in the parliament on Thursday (09). (Colombo/June 09/2022)"
