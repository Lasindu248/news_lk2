  "body_lines": [
    "The motion picture academy on Friday banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars or any other academy event for 10 years following his slap of Chris Rock at the Academy Awards.",
    "The move comes after a meeting of the academy\u2019s Board of Governors to discuss a response to Smith\u2019s actions.",
    "\"The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage,\u201d the academy said in a statement.",
    "\u201cI accept and respect the Academy\u2019s decision,\u201d Smith said in response. He pre-emptively resigned from the academy last week during the run-up to the meeting, calling his actions \u201cshocking, painful, and inexcusable.\u201d",
    "Smith will keep the Oscar he won after the slap, and he will remain eligible to be nominated for and to win more of them in the 10-year period, though he can\u2019t show up to accept them."
