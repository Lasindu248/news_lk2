    "The last week beginning May 9, 2022 was the one before Wesak, now celebrated locally, regionally, and by the UN as symbolic of Gautama Buddha\u2019s message of peace and loving kindness. And yet Sri Lanka, where Buddhists celebrate this event\u00a0annually as a special\u00a0occasion, was trapped again\u00a0in frightening episodes of violence. Wesak day this week end is being \u201ccelebrated\u201d as never before in 74 years, of independence\u00a0with very limited or no access to food , fuel, gas and\u00a0 electricity, and a nation in bankruptcy\u00a0obtaining handouts\u00a0from across its shores, like a failed State.",
    "Yet the\u00a0 Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led government is still in office, despite islandwide street\u00a0 protests calling\u00a0 for the resignation of the President and government. A new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in at the end of the week.\u00a0 Three or four seniors of the government\u2019s Pohottuwa Party, including\u00a0 GL Pieris and Dinesh Gunewardene have been\u00a0 sworn in again (perhaps for a third time in weeks)\u00a0 \u00a0after resigning and reappearing\u00a0in cabinet\u00a0 office in\u00a0 repeatedly\u00a0 reconstituted and disbanded\u00a0Gotabaya Rajapaksa cabinets. It is clear that Gotabaya Rajapakse with Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s support intends to remain in office.",
    "Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is being hailed\u00a0in some quarters including some media as\u00a0 the \u201czero to hero\u201d man of the moment\u00a0 with a penchant for\u00a0 \u201csnappy jokes \u201d (Sunday Times 15.5.22)\u00a0 who will save this nation from economic\u00a0 collapse. This must not cloud our eyes to grave realities. If statesmanlike decisions are not made by all concerned at this defining time for our country, within the framework of what is doable under our Constitution, we may witness further violence unrest and instability that will place at risk our collective future. Surely superficial conversations and media hype on the \u201cstability\u201d that a Rajapaksa/Wickremesinghe government will bring to our country must not cloud our vision and confuse our understanding of the realities of our political and economic crisis.",
    "Let us look back on the ground realities\u00a0of a defining week of events in the life of our country. For they do have grave implications for our survival as a nation in the Parliamentary system of governance that we have known for seven decades.",
    "For over a month islandwide street protests, in public gatherings saw unity among\u00a0people of different races religions ages and class striving to claim back\u00a0 for the first time the constitutionally recognized right of a Sovereign people to accountable governance. They refuse to give\u00a0legitimacy any longer to politician\u2019s gross\u00a0misuse of national resources, arrogant abuse of power, fiscal\u00a0profligacy and mismanagement embedded in\u00a0 corruption. They demand that the current President and government\u00a0accept responsibility for making the country a near failed State\u00a0in two and a half years of office, making daily life impossible to bear. They want systemic and institutional changes in governance. They want a TRANSFER of the responsibilities of governance to a\u00a0 NEW INTERIM ALL PARTY government .A government that has failed has in their\u00a0view lost its mandate, and must leave office. Hence the GOTA GO HOME cry across the island\u00a0in ever growing street protests, reinforced in the demands of\u00a0 \u00a0trade unions of varied professions and worker groups.",
    "These street\u00a0protests have lead to the President being\u00a0forced to change his cabinet many times in the last few weeks- surely another illustration of failed governance and political leadership. On May the President\u2019s brother PM Mahinda Rajapaksa was forced out of office despite indicating over and over again that he would not resign. It seemed as if the People\u2019s movement for change in governance would be realized, and the People would have a NEW\u00a0 all Party interim government, in place of the Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led Executive\u00a0branch of government. Proposals for a transfer of power from President Rajapaksa to an interim cabinet delinked from him and his party ,\u00a0 according to a time line,\u00a0 seemed to have reached a stage of implementation.",
    "A fiery speech by a Prime\u00a0Minister resigning office, a door opened from his official residence to the street, enabled his equally fiery supporters\u00a0to emerge, and perpetrate acts of violence against a peaceful peoples\u2019 movement demanding\u00a0his resignation.",
    "This was followed by a chain of events in response to this violence, flashed\u00a0on the TV screens and phones of stunned citizens. There were gross acts of harassment and physical violence that resulted in some loss of life and extensive damage to property. Buildings belonging to identified members of the government, mostly in the Provinces, were set ablaze and burned to the ground.\u00a0\u00a0 There are conspiracy theories\u00a0floating around every day as to the active hand in these targeted\u00a0acts of violence. These become even more sinister when we note the silence, until recently, of leading politicians and former Ministers whose homes were reduced to ashes or trashed. Some have even taken oaths of office in what is described as another new Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet as if nothing untoward has happened. This, when citizens are coping with a range of impossible\u00a0problems that impact their everyday lives, leaving them confused and desperate.",
    "The Prime Minister who left\u00a0office was holed up in a Navy fortified base. Screaming\u00a0protesters call upon him to emerge. Armed naval personnel stood silently above, watching and observing the scene, guns pointed at\u00a0 \u00a0the protesters.",
    "A few days later a silent President emerges from hibernation and addresses the nation. He tells us all that we are in the \u201cworst economic and political crisis of our times,\u201d with the calmness\u00a0of a person so alienated from reality, that he does not see that he and his government of two and a half years\u00a0 \u00a0caused the economic collapse and bankruptcy of the nation. He calmly assures citizens that he will make everything\u00a0right for everyone again. Citizens watched in horror as acts of gross violence\u00a0were perpetrated with no law enforcement authorities\u00a0in sight. Yet the President assures\u00a0us that he is there to protect us citizens from violence. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made no reference\u00a0to the demand\u00a0for his resignation, and transfer of the responsibilities of governance to an interim government that he will NOT lead.\u00a0 No reference is made to the strident calls for him to recognise that he, the all empowered Executive President of the 20th Amendment brought in Parliament soon after taking office, and his government, have abysmally failed the nation, and must\u00a0leave office.",
    "The next day we witnessed with amazement the President\u00a0swearing in Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister of his government to replace\u00a0his brother who had just resigned. The President had asked Mr. Sajith Premadasa, Leader of the Opposition to form an Interim\u00a0government. Mr. Premadasa and the SJB are being now faulted\u00a0in many\u00a0pro-protest\u00a0quarters for refusing this offer.",
    "We have completely forgotten that what the people were demanding in street protests was an interim government that was NOT headed by any Rajapaksa. When the SJB\u2019s principled stand demanded assurances that there would be a transfer of power to an all Party\u00a0 interim Prime Minister and cabinet, with a time line for a presidential\u00a0 resignation, the President unilaterally decided to appoint Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was willing to JOIN\u00a0 his Pohottuwa\u00a0 government and\u00a0 be\u00a0HIS government\u2019s Prime Minister. The concept of an \u201cinterim new government\u201d to whom there would be a transfer\u00a0of responsibility from the President and his old government has now been reinvented by President Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe to perpetuate\u00a0 (possibly for the whole of their term) the Pohottuwa Party government led\u00a0 by President\u00a0Gotabaya Rajapaksa AND Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is a \u201cconstitutional\u00a0coup\u201d of the Rajapaksa\u2019s reminiscent of the events of 2018, but with Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe now our six times Prime Minister, derailing the Peoples\u2019 movement for change and perpetuating Rajapaksa governance in this country, despite the challenges sustained to this governance, for over a month\u00a0 in vibrant street protests.",
    "The resigning former PM whose passport has been impounded by Court, pending investigations\u00a0into alleged crimes, congratulated with alacrity the new PM, his President brother\u2019s personal choice. Another family\u00a0member and former minister (whose passport has also been impounded) showered blessings on the new PM.\u00a0This is a final act of undermining the street protests calling for systemic and institutional changes in government by the Rajapaksas. Legitimizing Ranil\u2019s apointment at PM",
    "On what basis did the President and Mr. Wickremesinghe conclude that Mr. Wickremesinghe and his party who were decimated in the polls, can be considered to command the confidence of Parliament as required by the Constitution for the appointment of a Prime Minister. Or is this a novel Rajapaksa/Wickremesinghe understanding of the norms of a Parliamentary democracy?",
    "The new PM, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe lost his seat in Parliament. He represents\u00a0no Sri Lankan citizen in the system of representative democracy in our Constitution, and system\u00a0of governance. He arrived\u00a0in Parliament\u00a0on a national list which he himself said some time ago was meant to bring outside technocrats and expertise into Parliament and was not meant as a sinecure for candidates defeated at elections. Yet he has been appointed as Prime Minister by the unilateral act of a President whose government\u00a0 \u00a0is under siege for failed administration, with a public demand that the President himself leaves office.\u00a0 Consequently a government headed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his favoured appointee to the office of PM, does NOT conform to the INTERIM government that the People desire at this time.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe when asked by a journalist how he sees the street protest or \u201caragalaya\u201d said with a smile \u201cOh that must go on. Continuing the aragalaya is very important.\u201d He did not explain how he can be PM in a Rajapaksa government, and also support a Peoples\u2019 movement or \u201caragalaya\u201d that is calling for a government that is NOT led by President Gotabhaya Rajapakse. Was this a tongue in cheek and facetious remark from a politician who attracts media attention for his \u201csnappy\u201d sense of humour. He was captured on TV recently dismissing a protest opposite his home as the response of the \u201ckello\u201d in a girls\u2019 school close by who, he said, fled the gathering to eat lunch at the Cinnamon Grand?",
    "We can dismiss Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s comment on the aragalaya as a\u00a0cynical aside not to be taken too seriously, given the embedded contradictions. But what is of concern is that it highlights what the country has witnessed, and his critics point to as Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s casual approach\u00a0to the fundamentals of governance in a Parliamentary democracy because he thinks market-led economic development must take priority. He is now reinforcing the criticism that while in office he took no action and ignored corruption at the highest level in the infamous\u00a0 bond scam scandal, which indeed cost him and his party their seats in Parliament.",
    "He violated norms of intra-party democracy in his leadership of a political party, and critics allege that this destroyed a long-established political party, the UNP. He clearly failed to seize the opportunities given to him to strengthen\u00a0democracy in the Rainbow coalition lead by him,\u00a0 after the Rajapaksa government was rejected in 2015, and again in 2018, after\u00a0 a path breaking Supreme Court decision that challenged Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s return to office. His contribution in\u00a0Parliamentary debates on this crisis which has gripped the nation, consistently demonstrates that a competent politician\u00a0is obsessed with the single concern of \u00a0\u201cfixing the economy.\u201d",
    "One of the problems in his approach is that he prioritizes economic growth and delinks it from fundamental issues of accountable governance in a Parliamentary democracy. As citizens we have every right to be concerned that Mr. Wickremesinghe will not respect the People\u2019s current demand for accountable and transparent governance \u2013 which they see as the urgent need of the hour \u2013 in his mission to save our nation from economic collapse. The lessons of history tell us that this approach will lead to further erosion of democratic governance in this country, and a resurgence of the Rajapaksa style of governance that has doomed this nation to economic collapse.",
    "The newly \u201canointed\u201d PM, appointed by a President whose very survival in the post is challenged, went through the usual political ritual of obtaining blessings in a Buddhist temple. He assured us with a smile that HE is the chosen one, that HE will deliver us from all our problems.\u00a0 HE knows it all and HE will be our Saviour. Journalists who ask specific questions on HOW he will handle proceedings in Parliament, and appointments of Cabinet Ministers, and\u00a0timelines, are\u00a0dismissed with a wave of the hand and a condescending smile. \u201cAll in good time, all in good time, leave it to me\u201d is the clear message of a person described in the press as a great \u201czero to hero\u201d in being. His most recent pronouncement indicates to the nation that HE has decided to privatize the national airline.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe has announced that he will be conducting his business with all his faithful partymen who lost the Parliamentary elections. They will now be his advisers and helpers, in steering the ship of State in troubled waters. They all announce to us with cheerful smiles, on many media channels that they are back again on a free ride, in the business of governance, as Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s stalwarts.",
    "Meanwhile diplomats of foreign nations (who one would think know the realities of the political scene in Sri Lanka due to prolonged islandwide street protests), shower the newly appointed PM with congratulatory and other messages. They are delighted with the appointment and see it as ushering the much desired \u201cstability\u201d in the country. Many of these persons are from countries with parliamentary democracies. It is not clear\u00a0how they came to the conclusion that the waving of a wand by a discredited President, in an appointment of a Prime Minister of a country with a month of strident, articulate and peaceful protests demanding an end to a government\u2019s corruption and abuse of power, can create this \u201cstable\u201d political environment.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe keeps assuring the public that he joined President Rajapaksa and the current government due to a great desire to help his country in its hour of need. Some media give him accolades for what they describe as his unselfishness and altruism. The public have a right to look behind the rhetoric and ask a hard question. Why did Mr. Wickremesinghe not stay in the Opposition and join\u00a0others and give leadership in constituting the All-Party Interim government that has been proposed, to hold the President\u00a0and government\u00a0accountable for their failures, and prevent them from continuing in office.",
    "Why has he contributed to sustaining the Rajapaksa government, thus legitimizing abuse of power, corruption, fiscal profligacy and mismanagement, that has brought this country to bankruptcy. Does a government whose actions have led to Sri Lanka being possibly designated a \u2018low-income country,\u201d because of its current impoverishment, deserve to get a new lease of life with RWs engagement? We need to ask that same question of all those leading civil society \u201cdemocratic governance\u201d activists, who praise the \u201cPeoples Movement\u201d and the \u201cspace it has provided for institutional and systemic change,\u201d and yet are very comfortable with a Wickremesinghe led Rajapaksa government. Are there some concerns regarding the \u201cbarbarians\u201d at the gates?",
    "The SJB and the JVP who have attempted to connect with the demands for accountable governance in street protests, have maintained their position. This is based on the principle that they are not willing to join an all-party interim government that is led by a failed President and his government, whose actions clearly show they have defaulted on Constitutional obligations and lost the mandate to govern. The SLFP and other parties swear they will not accept cabinet office in the Gotabaya/Ranil Wickremesinghe government and will sit in the Opposition as independents.\u00a0But they WILL accept its usefulness at this time and WILL support them when necessary. No mention of the clear contradiction in saying this, supporting the Peoples\u2019 movement, and legitimizing the President\u2019s decision to continue in office with HIS government AND Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. The TNA after an initial statement by its spokesman, indicating support for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa/Wickremesinghe government in a limited way, has now clarified that the unilateral appointment of Mr. Wickremesinghe contradicts basic norms of democracy. It is taking the position that the President has lost his mandate and has no right to continue in office.",
    "We as citizens, witnessing the events of this week and conduct of our politicians may well ask: Are we in a country we can describe as Paradise Lost, Crow\u2019s Island, Mynah or Cuckoo Land? We should ask ourselves \u2013 Why do we permit our rulers to do this to us?",
    "We must re-enforce and strengthen current efforts to ensure that our governance is accountable to the People. We must support every effort within and outside Parliament to strengthen democracy so that it becomes functional and not dysfunctional. Perhaps it is useful even at this late stage to examine whether our Constitution can enable us to arrive at a solution to this impasse, where a failed government refuses to leave office, and the People want systemic and institutional change. Especially when a government has so pauperized the country that it can\u2019t afford to settle all through a General Election.",
    "1) Is it not possible to have some clarity in regard to what the People WANT as an \u2018Interim Government\u201d to tide over the crisis. The People want an interim government that is NOT led by the Rajapaksas, whom they hold accountable for the current crisis. They reject the corruption and abuse of power that has brought the country to this predicament. They say they have lost the mandate given to them to govern.",
    "Mr. Wickremesinghe obtaining the government\u2019s support and getting their votes in Parliament to lead a Rajapaksa government is not the Peoples\u2019 concept of an all-party \u201cinterim government.\u201d (The protesters on the\u00a0 \u00a0Streets have just baptized him with a new name: Ranil Rajapaksa!) It is this confusion and total disregard of ground realities on the nation\u2019s demand for an interim government for a short period to manage the crisis, which has led to the President appointing Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM, offering to work together in leading the nation out of the current crisis.",
    "2) When Parliament meets next, is it not\u00a0 \u00a0the duty of ALL Parliamentarians to recognize that the President and his government have lost the mandate to govern. Those who support the Peoples\u2019 demand for a regime change must then vote together and ensure that a new Prime Minister and a cabinet of all other parties represented in Parliament forms an interim government. They must work for a consensus in this regard, and not permit the continuation of the SAME government, now led by the President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the support of the President\u2019s party in Parliament.",
    "3) The opposition in Parliament and those who support the island wide street protests can then also pass the No Confidence Motion against the President. This will give a clear message, legitimizing the call for his resignation. Hopefully, the President and Mr. Wickremesinghe will understand this message, which reflects ground realities on street protests, and the demands made for a change. Mr. Wickremesinghe can then become a member of an OPPOSITION \u00a0interim cabinet, but not as Prime Minister of the CURRENT government, supported by a vote of confidence of THIS government.",
    "4) The President can in conformity with the Constitution appoint an all-party interim Prime Minister, and a Cabinet that is\u00a0 \u00a0NOT from his OWN party, unless the new Prime Minister of the Opposition or independent group in Parliament, invites them to be part of the new cabinet.",
    "5) The interim Prime Minister and Cabinet, representative of all parties, can be constituted as the new executive branch of government. They can function as part of the executive for a defined maximum period of ONE \u2013 TWO months. During this time the 21 Amendment can be brought to Parliament for the abolition of the Executive Presidency with relevant changes in governance. Once this amendment is passed the President will cease to hold office, and provision can be made for the continuity of the Prime Minister and cabinet of the interim government, until the General Elections are held.",
    "A timeline can be set for the holding of these elections. The office of President will then become one held by\u00a0 \u00a0a ceremonial Head of State, as in many other democracies. The systemic and institutional changes in governance demanded by the People in the islandwide street protests will be facilitated by this Constitutional change. Such a Constitutional change should not be postponed for longer on mythical arguments of \u201cinstability\u201d. The Constitution has clear provisions on the transfer of power when the President leaves office.\u00a0It is up to Party leaders to understand and use them.",
    "The scenes witnessed in Parliament on May 17 have made it very clear that the President with his Pohottuwa\u00a0 majority in Parliament, will continue to\u00a0 dictate the agenda for governance, fortified by the new addition to the front bench, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. As he sat silently, in his new seat, Minister GL Pieris popped up once again to nominate a male candidate to the office of Deputy Speaker against a woman candidate, apparently suggested by Mr. Wickremesinghe in his different avatar. Inevitably she lost the vote. Mr. Wickremesinghe then came up with a spurious procedural argument, which effectively scuttled the possibility of a debate in Parliament on the Censure Motion against the President. What else could he have done, from his prestigious seat as Prime Minister on the Front Bench, gifted to him by the President and his failed Pohottuwa government?",
    "Shakespeare, that disturbing bard from across the oceans said, \u201cVaulting ambition doth o\u2019er leap itself\u201d. Only time will tell whether the most recent and highly publicized\u00a0 pole vault will result in a leap of power\u00a0 that will once again link individual ambitions to a nation\u2019s destruction. Those of us who have interacted with some of the competent professionals in Parliament, ask ourselves why through decades in public life many of them have not been to our nation, as Tagore said, \u201cMen whom the lust of office cannot buy.\u201d The answer perhaps lies in that wise statement of a great judge of a great Commonwealth court, Lord Acton who said, \u201c(access to) power corrupts and (access to) absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d",
