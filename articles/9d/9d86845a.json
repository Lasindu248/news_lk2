    "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka has agreed in principle to approve emergency power purchase subject to conditions laid down by the Commission.",
    "The PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake said the cabinet had declared an \u201cemergency situation\u2019 in the energy sector under section 43(4) (c) (ii) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in keeping with the directive of the President.",
    "\u201cThe main issue for the power crisis that Sri Lanka is facing is not due to inadequate supply of Fuel and not enough rain,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "\u201cInsufficient funds to buy enough fuel to drive\u00a0 thermal power plants is the main reason for continual power interruptions in the country. We also have used hydro reserves in the reservoirs excessively in the months of December last year and January this year to generate electricity,\u201d",
    "However, Ratnayake said adequate supply of fuel to power plants could immediately resolve the rolling power outages in the country that has caused 200\u2013400 MW loss to the national grid. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
