    "Sri Lankan authorities -- as well as fans -- had pleaded with the Aussies to go ahead with the cricket series, as it is expected to bring in much-needed foreign exchange to the island.",
    "So far, 1.7 million people in the nation of 22 million are in need of \u201clife-saving assistance\u201d, the UN said, while more than three-quarters of the population have reduced their food intake due to severe food shortages across the country.",

    "\u201cNow is the time for the international community to show solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt in April, and is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout."
