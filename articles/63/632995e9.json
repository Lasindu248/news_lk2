    "CODA has been named best picture, beating out the likes of Belfast, Drive My Car and Power of the Dog at the 2022 Academy Awards. It\u2019s a historic win for a film that brings Deaf culture, and Deaf actors, to the forefront.",
    "Written and directed by Sian Heder, CODA is based on the 2014 French film La Famille B\u00e9lier.",
    "The English-language remake centers on Ruby Rossi, the only hearing member of a Deaf family, who struggles to balance family obligations and her love of music.",
    "\u201cCODA does have a double meaning in the title because it\u2019s Children of Deaf Adults, but it\u2019s also the end of a piece of music,\u201d director Sian Heder said.",
    "Distributed by Apple TV+, it is also the first best picture win for a streaming service. The film earned three of Apple TV+\u2019s six Oscar nominations, and won each one: best picture, best adapted screenplay for Sian Heder, and best supporting actor for Troy Kotsur, who joins his co-star Marlee Matlin as the only Deaf actors ever win Oscars for acting.",
    "Will Smith wins his first-ever Oscar \u2013 for best actor in \u2018King Richard\u2019"
