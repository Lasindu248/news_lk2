Leading value-added coir-based export company Ravi Industries Ltd. was awarded for pioneering a grassroot collection programme for palmyrah-based fibre from smallholders in Jaffna, connecting more local micro-entrepreneurs to global markets.",

    "The Group\u2019s ability to innovate solutions for customers despite extremely challenging circumstances was demonstrated by its service-oriented sectors. The Hayleys Advantis team was felicitated for undertaking the first international rig tow by a Southeast Asian company. The team moved a semi-submersible 13,500-ton drilling rig from offshore Kakinada India to Batam Indonesia \u2013 braving busy maritime channels and bad weather for a distance of 1600 nautical miles."
