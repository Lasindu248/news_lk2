    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The chairman of the state-run Litro Gas Company Ltd tendered his resignation to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, accusing former ministers of the current ruling party and the government for the current economic crisis in the country.",
    "In his resignation letter, Theshara Jayasinghe said, the ministers and the government officers which the Litro company comes under did not support the decisions taken by him in order to stop illegal activities in the company.",
    "He said he decided to resign effective immediately from April 14, 2022, onwards after considering the current cooking gas shortage and principles regarding the current economic situation in the country.",
    "\u201cMajority of the ministers and members of the parliament representing the ruling party are trying to escalate the current situation rather than supporting the government to control it. The question I have is, is it because of the decisions I took from the start to stop the corruption within the organization? Jayasinghe stated in the letter.",
    "Jayasinghe said, right after his appointment as the Chairman of Litro in 2021, he was able to stop the selling of 18-litre cooking gas cylinder that was issued to the market, with a changed composition of the gas in cylinders which later were going to have caused bursts.",

    "\u201cAfter discussing with you regarding these international mafias which resulted in the loss of billions of rupees, I tried at my level best to stop all the corruption. However, it was hard due to the challenges faced by the authorities from the management and at the social level. It was clear all the incidents that happened from that moment were all according to a pre-planned script\u201d Jayasinghe said.",
    "Jayasinghe said the current gas shortage cannot be solved by discussions within the organizations, and all parties involved in the economy should support it.",
    "\u201cThe devaluation of the rupee, forex shortage in importing gas, difficulties faced by the state owned and private banks and predictions regarding the economic situation of the country made by foreign investors are some of the issues that cannot be solved within the organizations\u201d Jayasinghe said.",
    "\u201cIt is a nauseating experience to see the officers responsible for the national monetary policy and money handling, not taking adequate measures solve this issue easily and letting the general public in the country to suffer due to negligence or with knowledge.\u201d",
