    "Fuel distribution will commence today after 2.00 pm soon after receiving the confirmation from the security authorities, a Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) official said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that the fuel distribution was completely suspended from Monday (May 9) due to the conflict situation that engulfed the country.",
    "\"With the start of the unrest, we immediately halted the distribution as there was no safety for the fuel bowsers.\"The security forces were unable to provide security for the bowsers. If people attack any fuel bowser, the possible fire could cause extensive damage in that particular area,\" he said.",
    "The security authorization to release fuel bowsers will be received today after 2.00 pm, he said.",
    "However, permission was granted for the fuel distribution to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), the Railways Department, Sri Lanka Ports Authority and to the armed forces guarded by security personnel. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
