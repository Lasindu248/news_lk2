    "In addition to this, the former Health Minister said that there is a shortage of 16 essential items necessary to conduct a surgery.",
    "The MP, however said that India, being aware of the medicine shortage, imposed restrictions to prevent Sri Lanka from importing medicine from any other country except for India, along with its Line of Credit.",
    "According to the conditions of this credit line, Sri Lanka cannot import medicine from any other country, even if it is possible to purchase these medicines for a lesser price from another country, which would eventually eliminate competition in the market.",
    "He stated that as many medicines are already being manufactured in Sri Lanka, the Government can instead import the raw materials needed for the production of medicine, and can even save foreign exchange in the process.",
