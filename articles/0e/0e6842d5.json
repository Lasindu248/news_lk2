    "The bourse bounced back yesterday in a remarkable manner with the All- Share Price Index making its biggest single-day points gain in history, following an approximately 1000 points plunge over two consecutive days, stock market analysts said.",
    "The stock market recovered well as investors remained concerned over high volatility in the macroeconomic situation. But with the bouncing back of the stock market, especially blue -chip counters witnessed significant gains during the trading, market analysts said.",
    "The reason for the stock market to move upwards after a two- day steep decline, is because investors have a gut feeling that the government would go for an IMF bailout.
