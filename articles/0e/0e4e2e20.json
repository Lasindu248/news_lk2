    "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB) MP Rajitha Senaratne yesterday claimed that his party had managed to secure more than 113 signatures for the no confidence motion against the government.",
    "\u201cWe have the necessary numbers for the motion as those who have left the government have pledged their support for us. The SJB earlier decided not to take up positions in an interim government which will be formed in the event the no confidence motion is approved and the present government is defeated. Our earlier stance was to keep away from an interim government but we changed our stance as those from independent groups said they will not support the no faith motion if we don\u2019t take up positions in an interim government,\u201d Dr. Senaratne said.",
    "\u201cThe days of the present government are numbered,\u201d he added.",
    "Meanwhile member of the independent group Jayantha Samaraweera said the independent group has decided to sign the no faith motion.\u201cOur stand is that an interim government should be appointed with a new Prime Minister,\u201d he said.(YOHAN PERERA)"
