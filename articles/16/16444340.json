  "body_lines": [
    "The Sri Lanka Shippers\u2019 Council (SLSC) requested all those concerned, involved in protest and strikes, to refrain from disrupting the activities of the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA), Sri Lanka Customs (SLC), Board of Investment (BoI) and the Airports to ensure their uninterrupted day-to-day operations, as they are essential services which are critical to the Country and its economy.",
    "They said the smooth operations of these institutions will ensure the continuous flow of importation of essentials such as Food, Fuel, Medicines, Inputs-for-Exports and imports - which will facilitate and ensure the inflow of much needed foreign exchange to sustain the country\u2019s economy in these difficult times.",
    "Disruptions to these services will add to the burdens already faced by the people with devastating consequences in the future.",
    "Therefore, the SLSV requested all right-minded citizens who are involved to recognize the importance of these critically important activities and thereby allow those to continue their services to see the country through this crucial period. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
