    "The Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) yesterday said that all-Island private bus services will resume to normalcy after tomorrow following the decision of the Power and Energy Minister.",
    "LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne told the Daily Mirror that more diesel stocks were already distributed, and by tomorrow, 50 percent of buses would be operating around the country.",
    "He said Minister Kanchana Wijesekera had promised to give 800,000 liters of diesel to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) including 600,000 liters for private buses.",
    "Therefore, the chairman requested people to use the private bus services rather than use their private vehicles for transport.",
    "Wijeratne also said that new air-conditioned bus service will be operated for the people of Colombo, and people will not experience any inconvenience when travelling. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
