    "BBC News; A court in Ukraine has jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the invasion.",
    "Captured soldier Sgt Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka on 28 February.",
    "He admitted shooting Mr Shelipov but said he had been acting on orders and asked forgiveness of the man\u2019s widow.",
    "Many other alleged war crimes are being investigated by Ukraine.",
    "And in a conflict where the deliberate targeting of civilians has become one of the defining features, Monday\u2019s outcome sets a significant legal precedent.",
    "Moscow has always denied its troops have targeted civilians, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary, while Ukraine says more than 11,000 crimes may have occurred.",
    "Ukraine, however, is likely to bring more cases like this to unpick Moscow\u2019s blanket denials.",
    "This sentencing is unlikely to lead to an immediate change in tactics from the invading forces, but it does bring Oleksandr Shelipov\u2019s widow Kateryna Shelipova justice.",
    "Imposing the life sentence, Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, 21, had carried out a \u201ccriminal order\u201d by a soldier of higher rank.",
    "\u201cGiven that the crime committed is a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order\u2026 the court does not see the possibility of imposing a [shorter] sentence of imprisonment,\u201d he said.",
    "Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out.",
    "His lawyer said an appeal would be lodged against the verdict.",
    "The Kremlin\u2019s response is already in motion, with laws being drafted and courts being set up in Russia to try some Ukrainian prisoners as war criminals.",
    "This suggests both countries could soon find themselves in a legal tit-for-tat while the conflict rages on.",
    "Shishimarin served in Russia\u2019s Kantemirovskaya tank division. At the time of the killing, he and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit.",
    "When they spotted Mr Shelipov he was speaking on his phone, Shishimarin told the court. He said he was told to shoot him with an assault rifle.",
    "His defence lawyer told the court on Friday that Shishimarin had only fired after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three to four rounds had hit the man.",
    "He said Shishimarin fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and he questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill.",
    "In one dramatic moment, the victim\u2019s widow Kateryna Shelipova confronted Shishimarin. \u201cTell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?\u201d she asked, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s justification for the invasion of Ukraine.",
    "\u201cProtect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?\u201d",
    "The soldier had no answer to that. Asking forgiveness of the widow earlier, he said: \u201cBut I understand you won\u2019t be able to forgive me.\u201d",
    "Ms Shelipova told the BBC: \u201cI feel very sorry for him but for a crime like that \u2013 I can\u2019t forgive him.\u201d",
    "Since President Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on 24 February, at least 3,838 civilians have been killed and 4,351 injured, according to the UN.",
    "Among the dead are numerous suspected victims of war crimes in occupied towns such as Bucha.",
    "Earlier this month, the BBC obtained CCTV footage of the killing of two civilians in cold blood allegedly by Russian soldiers, a case now being investigated by prosecutors as a suspected war crime.",
