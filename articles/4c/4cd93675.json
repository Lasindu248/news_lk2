    "\u201cOur party decided that the leader should participate in the APC as we see it as a forum to resolve the crisis which the country is facing today,\u201d Kariyawasam said.",
    "\u201cAlso we might be blamed for missing an opportunity to put a collective effort to pull the nation through from the crisis,\u201d he added.",
    "Asked about the decision made by other opposition parties to boycott the conference, Kariyawasam said decisions made by other parties are not relevant to the UNP.",
    "He said it is time to forget party differences and get together and establish a common forum to resolve the burning issues which the country is facing today. \u201cTaking to the streets and staging protests will not resolve any issue,\u201d Kariyawasam said.",
    "He invited all political parties to join the Sathyagraha which is to be held at Hyde Park on March 25 saying the objective of it is to build up a common forum where it will be possible to establish a common national framework for the nation. (Yohan Perera)"
