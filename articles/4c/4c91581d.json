    "The final report of the investigation which the Bribery Commission had initiated with regards to two Sri Lankans Nirupama Rajapaksa and Thirukumar Nadesan, listed in the controversial Pandora Papers would be released soon, the government informed Parliament today.",
    "Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando said the final report was delayed as former MP Ranjan Ramanayake, who wanted to make a statement in connection with the incident, took time to do so citing various reasons.",
    "He said Ramanayake had submitted his statement through an affidavit only a few days ago and added that the final report would be finalised and released soon.",
    "He said this responding to a question raised by National People's Power MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the progress of the investigation into the revelation of Pandora Papers and why the report was not submitted to the President even after four months whereas he had called for a report within a month.
