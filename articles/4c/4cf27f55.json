  "body_lines": [
    "The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) says it is withdrawing its membership from any activity pertaining unsolicited proposals hereon, adding it recognises the need to change the administrative system and install better governance.",
    "\u201cThis includes the disgraceful New Fortress LNG procurement deal,\u201d the release adds.",
    "The CEBEU also called on authorities to reinstall proper administrative and good governance practices, and stand against the conduct of a handful of individuals, which includes the present CEB Chairman who has facilitated unsolicited deals, the CEBEU release charged.\u00a0 \u201cAs a trade union of professionals, we have decided to initiate the system change within CEB by fighting against a major root cause of evil that attracted and sustained corrupt practices and bred corrupt individuals. This single reason has caused more damages to the sector, financially and otherwise than any other. The mere possibility to bring in lucrative unsolicited proposals has allowed corrupt political authorities to intervene and alter engineering decisions, delay low-cost power projects, block transparent procurement practices,\u201d the CEBEU added."
