  "body_lines": [
    "The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) whilst condemning Monday\u2019s violence, said yesterday a new Government is urgently needed.",
    "\u201cWe call upon leaders and authorities to immediately restore political stability across the country. They should also ensure a safe living and working environment for all people, as we collectively navigate through this very difficult crisis,\u201d JAAF said in a statement.",
    "\u201cBy the same token, we strongly support the efforts taken by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka to ensure a peaceful, democratic transition of power. It is critical that a new government be appointed urgently to fill the current political vacuum,\u201d it added.",
    "JAAF said it will also support the efforts of all other organisations that seek the same outcome: an end to the crisis, to the potential violence and a return to political stability.",
    "It said the violence that erupted on the streets of Colombo and in other parts on Monday, and the resultant loss of life is both unfortunate and deeply saddening.",
    "\u201cWe empathise with the people\u2019s distress over the extraordinary adverse impact of the economic crisis on their lives and livelihoods. However, violence that costs precious human lives deserves our utmost condemnation,\u201d JAAF added."
