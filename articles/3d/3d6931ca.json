    "The operations between Sri Lanka and Moscow, Russia have been suspended with effect from today due to operational restrictions that are outside of the airline\u2019s control, SriLankan Airlines announced today.",
    "\u201cThe restrictions are in the form of international financial and aircraft insurance limits which have been imposed on Russia due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and directly impact SriLankan Airlines\u2019 flight operations to Russia. Accordingly, SriLankan Airlines will cease operations to Moscow until further notice,\u201d a statement issued by SriLankan Airlines said.",
    "\u201cThe airline expresses regret for any inconvenience caused to customers by this decision taken on account of a force majeure situation. SriLankan will continue to monitor the situation in Russia, and hopes to restart operations once conditions improve. SriLankan maintained two weekly flights between Colombo and Moscow before the cessation of operations,\u201d it added."
