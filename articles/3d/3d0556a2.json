    "Claiming that the National People's Power (NPP) is ready to work in unison to rescue the country from its economic woes as requested by the Finance Minister, NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today it would be a useless move unless the President and Prime Minister resign.",
    "He told Parliament that the President was responsible for the economic crisis and that the NPP was not ready to support an all-party government when the President is still steering the country.",
    "He said the present economic debacle is a result of the failed economic policies such as printing money, ban on chemical fertilizer and stop the import of raw materials.",
    "\"The President, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Finance Minister cannot get away by accepting that they had made the mistake. This is not a minor mistake. It is a serious issue,\" he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
