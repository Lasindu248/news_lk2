  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has imposed up to 13-hour power cut for Thursday (31) as acute diesel shortage has compelled the utility provider to increase the duration of power cuts from the previous day\u2019s 10 hours.",
    "The CEB has decided to cut power from 12am to 8am for the first time in the ongoing power crisis.",
    "Areas ABCDEF and PQRS will see 3 hours of power cut from 3am to 6am, 4 hours from 12pm to 4pm and 6 hours from 6pm to 12am.",
    "Areas GHIJKL and TUVW will experience 3-hour power cut from 12am to 3am, 4 hours from 8am to 12pm and 6 hours from 4 pm to 10pm.",
    "Areas MNOXYZ, however, will witness only 5.5-hour power cut \u2013 3.5-hour interruption from 5.30am to 9am and 2 hours from 4pm to 6pm.",
    "Though the government has said the duration of the power cuts will be reduced gradually, the power cut has been extended mainly due to lack of fuel amid severe shortage of US dollars.",
    "The lack of fuel also has resulted in large queues for diesel and petrol despite record price hikes. (Colombo/ March 30/2022)"
