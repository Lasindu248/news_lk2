    "Refuting reports that the double lid main door at the entrance to the Galle Fort, fitted by the Dutch who built the fort in the 17th century AD, has been removed, the Central Cultural Fund said today that the door was dismantled recently only to carry out repairs.",
    "A senior official of the CCF said the door made of iron had been in a dilapidated state and it was dismantled for renovations.\u00a0 He said the door was about 3.79 meters tall, 2.59 meters wide, and 18 cent meters thick.",
    "He said the Department of Archaeology had renovated it in 2007 prior to the conservation project undertaken by the CCF.",
    "He said funds were not yet available to conserve and re-fit the door since it was not a pre-planned job but steps would be taken to make an allocation to meet the expenditure.(Sirangika Lokukaravita and D.G.Sugathapla)"
