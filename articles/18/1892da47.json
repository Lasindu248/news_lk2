    "Russia\u2019s flagship carrier yesterday announced that it is suspending commercial flights to Sri Lanka after the island nation\u2019s authorities detained the airline\u2019s Airbus A330 jet on June 02.",
    "\u201cAeroflot is suspending commercial flights to Colombo (Sri Lanka) for the immediate period due to an unreliable situation in terms of the airline\u2019s unobstructed flights to Sri Lanka. The sales of tickets for flights to Colombo have been temporarily shut down,\u201d Russian state-owned news agency TASS said quoting the airline.",
    "In its statement, Aeroflot has said its passengers located in Colombo with return tickets for the 2nd, 4th and 5th of June will be brought to Russia on the 4th and 5th of June.",
    "Repatriation planes will fly to Colombo without passengers, it added.",

    "On Friday (June 03), Aeroflot reported that the departure of its SU-289 flight from Colombo to Moscow scheduled for June 2 was at first delayed and then cancelled due to the absence of permit from Sri Lanka\u2019s aviation authorities.",
    "Passengers of the cancelled flight were subsequently accommodated at hotels in Colombo.",
    "Earlier, Colombo\u2019s Commercial High Court satisfied a complaint filed by Ireland\u2019s Celestial Aviation Trading Limited leasing company against Aeroflot and banned its Airbus A330 jet from leaving the country until June 16.
