    "Officials Sunday said the central bank of Bangladesh made the decision to extend the swap period with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).",
    "A board-of-directors meeting of the Bangladesh Bank, held in its office in Dhaka on the day with BB Governor Fazle Kabir in the chair, adopted the decision.",

    "Actually, the CBSL will enjoy a nine-month extension of the currency deal for three installments, he explained.",
    "The central bank provided a total of $200 million to help prop up the island nation\u2019s fast-depleting foreign reserves and ease pressure on its exchange rate.",
    "The decision on the currency swap was set in motion during Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s visit to Bangladesh in March 2021.",

    "J.P. Morgan analysts estimate Sri Lanka\u2019s gross debt servicing would amount to $7.0 billion in 2022 and a current-account deficit of around $3.0 billion, according to media reports."
