    "He told Parliament that if this political crisis is not resolved, it will not be possible to address the economic woes as well.",
    "He said all people irrespective of party politics, appeal to the President to resign and added that it was absurd talking about any solution without his resignation.",
    "MP Herath said new political leadership should be brought into find solutions to the economic crisis and said it was the only solution to the issue.",
    "He also said if this government also acted arbitrarily, it should be defeated by moving a no confidence motion against it.",
    "\"We are ready to support both impeachment and no confidence motion,\" he said.",
    "Commenting on the moves to seek IMF assistance, he said they were against the government adhering to IMF conditions which would be detrimental to the country.",
    "\"We have sought IMF assistance 16 times in the past. We had to privatize state enterprises when obtaining IMF loans. What we should do is to talk to the IMF to reschedule our loans through a third party,\" he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)"
