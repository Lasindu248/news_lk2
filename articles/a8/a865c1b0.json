  "body_lines": [
    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday said that it supported Sri Lanka\u2019s plans to engage in \u201ccollaborative dialogue\u201d with creditors, a day after the country unilaterally suspended external debt payments amid a severe economic crisis.",
    "\u201cWe assessed Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to be unsustainable and that the country\u2019s fiscal efforts and macroeconomic policy adjustments alone could not restore debt sustainability,\u201d Masahiro Nozaki, IMF\u2019s mission chief for Sri Lanka, told Reuters.",
    "\u201cTherefore, we welcome the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 plan to engage in a collaborative dialogue with their creditors,\u201d Nozaki said, adding that the IMF was assessing the specific implications of Sri Lanka\u2019s recent announcement.",
    "Fitch Ratings said it has downgraded Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019.",
    "The agency said the downgrade reflects its view that a sovereign default process has begun.",
    "Fitch said long-term local-currency IDR has been affirmed at \u2018CCC\u2019 and country ceiling at \u2018B minus\u2019, adding that issue ratings on foreign-currency bonds issued on international markets have also been downgraded to \u2018C\u2019 from \u2018CC\u2019.",
    "Meanwhile global rating agency Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) today also lowered Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term foreign currency sovereign rating from \u201cCCC\u201d to \u201cCC\u201d to reflect looming default on some affected obligations.",
    "S&P Global Ratings said it could take months for Sri Lanka to restructure its foreign debt, a day after the country announced it would default on the $51 billion it has borrowed.",
    "It said it would likely assign Sri Lanka a \u201cselective default\u201d foreign currency rating after getting confirmation it had missed payment on interest coupons due on April 18.",
    "S&P said it expected Sri Lanka would miss these payments and in the meantime it lowered Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating to \u201cCC\u201d, which means highly vulnerable to default.",
    "Sri Lanka announced Tuesday a default on its foreign debt as the island nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in memory and escalating protests demanding the government\u2019s resignation."
