  "title": "Abolish executive presidency, Sri Lanka opposition says in fiery speech",
  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka must abolish the all-powerful executive presidency and strengthen parliament without paving the way to a similarly dictatorial premiership while ensuring adequate checks and balances, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa said.",
    "In a fiery, strongly-worded speech in parliament on Tuesday, Premadasa said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the entire government must resign.",
    "\u201cThe time has come to change the executive presidency. Let us use this opportunity,\u201d he said.",
    "Addressing prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa directly, Premadasa said certain government MPs opposed giving him more powers when drafting the 20th amendment to the constitution.",
    "The amendment restored the powers taken away from the presidency by the previous 19th amendment that was passed under the Yahapalana government of President Maithripala Siresena, who incidentally called for the reinstatement of the 19th amendment with further amendments on Tuesday.",
    "Bring back 19th amendment, rescind 20th: Sri Lanka former president Sirisena",
    "The opposition leader said it is abundantly clear that rather than just rescinding the 20th amendment, the entire executive presidency should be abolished.",
    "\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean a prime minister that can do whatever he wants either. There needs to be checks and balances,\u201d he said.",
    "Referring to the wave of public protests seen islandwide against the government\u2019s handling of Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis, Premadasa said the on-the-ground demand is for President Rajapaksa and the entire government to step down.",
    "\u201cThis government must resign from president downwards. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d",
    "The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) leader said he doesn\u2019t believe that not all MPs in the government are bad or that all MPs in the opposition \u00a0are good, and that smart, capable people exist on both sides that can form an intelligent team that can see Sri Lanka through the present crisis.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019 t think this country deteriorated over 74 years. If that\u2019s true, then free education has been a sham, as was [the Mahapoloa university scholarship] and even winning the war,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m also open to being criticised by our people. There will be no disciplinary inquiries,\u201d he added.",
    "Premadasa also rejected a call by President Rajapaksa for an interim administration with representation from all parties.",
    "\u201cWe won\u2019t participate in musical chairs,\u201d he said, adding that the SJB MPs have no desire for power or position.",
    "\u201cWe will come with the blessings of the people, not for power and privileges,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Apr05/2022)"
