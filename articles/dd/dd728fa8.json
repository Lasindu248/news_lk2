    "A tug of water seems to have broken out between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa with the latter now preparing to push for the 19th amendment which will take away the powers of the executive and empower more powers back to the Parliament.",
    "The Daily Mirror learns that for weeks now, there has been severe political instability among the government parties and its coalition members, many of who are now seated in the opposition with the 11 member alliance calling for Mahinda Rajapaksa to resign as the Prime Minister while some others stating that if there is a resignation then it should be the President who should step down.",
    "Senior political sources said that the recent cabinet appointments and all the state ministry appointments were done by the President's selection alone and the Prime Minister was not consulted nor did he attend the swearing-in ceremonies.",
    "The Prime Minister had been calling for some senior ministers to be included in the cabinet but President Rajapaksa had insisted for a younger and new cabinet, hoping that this would calm down the protestors and put the country back on track.",
    "The Prime Minister is now to table the 19th amendment in Parliament soon with some amendments to the clauses while the Daily Mirror learns that the main opposition the SJB will also table the 19th amendment in Parliament this week.",
    "UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who has also hinted that he will support the 19 amendment has proposed for a two-day discussion with the All-Party Leaders where proposals are going to be sought as to what the immediate solution to the crisis should be.",
    "The Daily Mirror learns that the party leaders will meet today and tomorrow to discuss the proposals and one of the proposals to which consensus will be sought from all party leaders is for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down as President.",
    "If consensus is reached, then the decision will be conveyed to the Speaker by Friday after which he will convey it to the President. However whether the President will then step down is to be seen. (JAMILA HUSAIN)"
