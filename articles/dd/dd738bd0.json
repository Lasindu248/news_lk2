    "A Russian Aeroflot flight has been grounded at the Katunayake International Airport from noon today (2) following an order issued by the Colombo Commercial High Court suspending its return flight to Russia.",
    "The Russian Flight SU-288 had arrived at the Katunayake Airport from Moscow, Russia at 10.10 am today.",
    "The flight was scheduled to depart for Moscow again at 12.50 pm today. More than 200 passengers had arrived at the Katunayake International Airport for the flight back.",
    "It has been reported that the flight has not been allowed to leave due to a commercial dispute with the aircraft leasing company. The Irish company that leases this aircraft had contacted the law firm in Colombo and had prevented the flight from proceeding further as Sri Lanka was one of the few destinations that the aircraft flies into.",
    "The Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka is reportedly in discussions with the Attorney General (AG) for a solution with regard to the matter.",
    "Meanwhile, the Colombo Commercial High Court has issued an order restraining the head of the Katunayake Airport Aviation Division from boarding the aircraft at the Katunayake Airport.",
    "Accordingly, the flight had been canceled and passengers arriving for the flight had been directed to tourist hotels around the Katunayake Airport.",
    "Sources at the Katunayake Airport said that discussions are currently underway to resolve the issue with the Chief of Air Staff of the Katunayake Airport, senior officials, Aeroflot officials and senior officials of the Attorney General\u2019s Department. (T.K.G Kapila)"
