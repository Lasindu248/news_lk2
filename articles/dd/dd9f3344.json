    "COLOMBO (News 1st); SriLankan Airlines issued a clarification with respect to speculation circulating on social media with respect to SriLankan Aircraft uplifting printed material to Entebbe International Airport in Uganda last year.",
    "SriLankan Airlines on Thursday (14) said it received an air cargo order to transport about 102 tons of printed material from Colombo to Entebbe International Airport in Uganda in February 2021.",
    "The consignment was purely commercial in nature and brought in much-needed foreign revenue to the airline and country at the time. SriLankan wishes to emphasize that this cargo order was undertaken for commercial reasons only, it added.",
    "The details of the cargo consignment were withheld due to contractual obligations as per air cargo industry standards said the statement.",
    "However, in response to concerns raised following the statement the national carrier tweeted to say that the Ugandan government ordered Ugandan currency notes from a global security printer who operates several factories worldwide, including one in Sri Lanka, exporting to global markets.",
    "It went on to note that SriLankan aircraft which were underutilized at this time (2021) during the pandemic were chartered by a UK-based freight forwarder.",
    "What is now being misunderstood is the Airline Pilots Guild\u2019s proud announcement of this achievement of using unutilized pax aircraft, it added.",
