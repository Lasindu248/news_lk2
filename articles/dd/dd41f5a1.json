    "State-run SriLankan Airlines has issued requests for proposals to lease up to 21 aircraft to support its long-term business strategy.",
    "The airline currently has 24 aircraft and aims to increase its fleet from 24 to 35 by 2025, including\u00a0 lease replacement aircraft when existing aircraft leases expires.",
    "\u201cThis includes two RFPs covering existing fleet types (320 and 330 family aircraft) and two parallel RFPs to compare with alternative aircraft types. Roughly 60 per cent of the planned aircraft will be for fleet replacement, and the remainder will be to support the airline\u2019s expansion strategy and meet the growing demand for air travel between Sri Lanka and the world,\u201d the airlines said in a statement.",
    "It also stated that Prior to the pandemic, in 2019, SriLankan had an all-Airbus fleet of 27 wide and narrow-bodied aircraft to service its short and long-haul operations. During Covid, there were no replacements for three aircraft that left the fleet. The airline currently has 24 aircraft to operate to 40 destinations in 25 countries.",
    "SriLankan is planning for measured growth in the next three years through frequency increases and the addition of new destinations as international travel is in a trajectory of recovery from the pandemic. The business plan of the airline necessitates a 35-aircraft-strong fleet by 2025. Additionally, it is critical to lease replacement aircraft when existing aircraft leases expire to sustain operations.\u00a0 Considering these factors, SriLankan plans to lease up to 21 aircraft from the forthcoming RFP process.",
    "SriLankan Airlines, the National Carrier of Sri Lanka and a member of the oneworld alliance, is an award-winning airline with a firm reputation as a global leader in service, comfort, safety, reliability, and punctuality. Launched in 1979, the airline's hub is located at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo providing convenient connections to its global network (including codeshare partners) of 126 destinations in 60 countries around the world. Its direct route map covers major cities across the Europe, Australia, Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and the Far East. The Airline operates an all-Airbus fleet including a state-of-the-art A330-300 and modern A320/321neo aircraft."
