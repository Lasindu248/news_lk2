    "The ZTE Blade V30 comes with a wide 6.67-inch Full HD IPS display, a 64MP AI quad-camera setup, 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, all supported by a very capable midrange chipset. The device is well-known for performing on par, or even better than, other comparable devices, but at a lower price point than other brands.",
    "The 64MP main rear camera provides exceptionally clear and vibrant photos and videos, even in lower light, while the device\u2019s powerful AI image correction always ensures that you get the best possible shot. The rear camera module, which is stylish, bold and reminiscent of much more expensive flagship devices, also comes equipped with an 8MP ultrawide lens for those wide shots, and a 5MP macro lens for gorgeous closeups, along with a 2MP depth sensor for beautiful depth of field effects.",
