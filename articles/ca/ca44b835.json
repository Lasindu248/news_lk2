    "While claiming that the decision to suspend wearing of face masks outdoors is unwise, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) urged the Government to rescind the decision with immediate effect given the fact that Sri Lankan is not out of the woods as yet in terms of COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "Issuing a special statement, AMS President Dr. Lakkumar Fernando said even though COVID-19 numbers are waning, there are new strains circulating (e.g., Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa) in different regions of the world, with potential to cause another wave of infections.",
    "\u201cIt is therefore unwise to drop our guard, especially with the current situation in the country. There are daily gatherings of people throughout the country, and there is a scarcity of medicines and other medical reagents,\u201d he pointed out.",
    "\u201cAn increase of COVID infections coupled with the inability to provide medical support for those in need would cause havoc, further undermining the deteriorating economic situation in the country,\u201d Dr. Fernando stressed.",
    "Thus, Dr. Fernando on behalf of the AMS reiterated that that the decision on masks be rescinded forthwith, especially at outdoor gatherings.\u00a0(Sheain Fernandopulle)"
