The exceptional planning and strategy devised by our senior management team has proven to be effective during the year, while we also benefitted from the rescinding of pandemic related restrictions. Furthermore, our commitment to working together with our customers in mutual partnership, placed us in an excellent position to detect early warning signs of financial distress, and helped us guide our customers towards making the right decisions.
