    "The Department of Immigration and Emigration yesterday informed that the one-day issuance of passports which was suspended due to urgent maintenance of the computer systems will resume from today.",
    "Although the normal passport issuances were resumed from 9 May, the one-day service was not available due to a technical glitch.",
    "Following the technical malfunction in the system last week, prior appointments to hand over passport applications have been made mandatory from 10 May.",
    "\u201cApplicants are requested to make their prior appointments via the website http://www.immigration.gov.lk/ or by contacting 0707101060. Services will be provided from 8.30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on public working days if the telephone number is used. As the daily issuing capacity of Passports of the Department is approximately 2,000 passports, people are kindly requested to avoid the inconvenience caused by visiting without making an appointment,\u201d the Department noted in a statement issued yesterday.",
    "It also dismissed the rumours that charges had been increased for the passport issuances and no stocks of passports.",
    "\u201cI would like to inform you that our staff is committed to serve and provide travel documents necessary,\u201d Department of Immigration and Emigration Controller General said."
