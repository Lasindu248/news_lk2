    "Pathum Nissanka's magnificent century powered Sri Lanka to a six-wicket win in the third ODI of the five-match series against Australia on Sunday at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.",
    "Nissanka scored 137 off 147 deliveries, finishing with 11 boundaries and two sixes. He was eventually dismissed by Jhye Richardson. Kusal Mendis was also set for a ton, but he had to retire hurt on 87.",
    "Australia won the toss and elected to bat and Travis Head (70*) top scored with Aaron Finch (62) and Alex Carey (49) in support to give Australia a respectable total of 291/6 to defend - Jeffrey Vandersay 3-49 was the top wicket taker for Sri Lanka."
