    "The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in stock will be expiring in July, an official said.",
    "According to sources, the vaccines are due to expire by the end of July.",
    "\u201cAs far as the expiry date of Pfizer vaccines is concerned, albeit there is no threat at present, the vaccines will have to be incinerated if we didn\u2019t reach the expected percentage which is at least 80 per cent,\u201d sources said.",
    "Commenting on the situation, COVID-19 Coordinator Dr. Anwar Hamdani told Daily Mirror that every drug and vaccine has its expiry dates and likewise, the current stock of Pfizer vaccines will be expiring in July.",
    "\u201cAt present, people still show slight hesitancy in getting the booster doses. However, the numbers have improved compared to where we were. The total number of recipients of booster dose is nearing 55 per cent, which needs to increase further,\" Dr Hamdani pointed out.",
    "Thus, he urged people to get the booster dose without being deceived by misinformation, as there has been no report of any harm caused to anyone due to the vaccine. (Sheain Fernandopulle)"
