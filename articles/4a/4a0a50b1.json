    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Rajitha Senaratne today said his son Chatura Senaratne was very much part of the SJB and slammed critics within the party who claimed that his son was not part of the political party.",
    "Senaratne told Daily Mirror that Chatura had attended the SJB protest as a party member and he was the Biyagama organizer for the SJB and a part of the working committee.",
    "\"Those members who claim that Chatura is not part of the SJB are unaware who their members truly are then. Chatura was a former parliamentarian and now the SJB Biyagama Organizer. No new member can claim he is not part of the party,\" Senaratne said.",
    "He added that Chatura had also contested the 2020 General Election under the SJB ticket.",
    "Following the SJB protest held on Tuesday, videos of Chatura attending the rally dressed in a full black attire, signaling the peace sign went viral. Responding to one such video, SJB member Rehaan Jayawickrema was quick to take on Twitter claiming that Chatura was not a member of the SJB and did not hold any position in the party. \"He joined the protest with his father,\" Rehaan claimed.",
    "To these allegations, Senaratne said, \"Rehaan does not know what he is talking about.\"",
    "Following Rajitha's strong reaction, Rehaan took to Twitter later this evening saying he was not aware that Chatura Senaratne was a part of SJB and he spoke on whatever information he was aware of. \"If MP Senaratne says that his son is a member, there are ways to resolve issues between party members without having to insult them.,\" Rehaan said."
