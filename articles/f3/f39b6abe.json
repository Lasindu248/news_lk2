    "Due to adequate diesel for the private buses, the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) has decided to stop operating from Monday (6).",
    "LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijerathne said they had to take the decision as soon as the ordinary level examination is over.",
    "He said the bus owners have to stand in queues for days to refuel their buses. Although it was stated that fuel would be issued from the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) depots, no formal programme was in place.",
    "If the government does not give priority to providing diesel to passenger buses this week, buses will be completely phased out from Monday, the chairman said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
