This is a job you cannot work by sitting in an office, and I have had discussions with different farmer groups already. There are skilled officials and experts in the field. We will get all of them onboard to ensure our people will not be impacted by the food scarcity,\u201d he added.",

    "\u201cI request farmers to finish paddy seeding by 10 June and continue on food crop cultivation in available lands to keep the predicted food crisis at bay. I also urge the public to start home-gardening food crops in pots and land available,\u201d he said.",
    "Noting that there are over 60 varieties of crops that can be cultivated at home gardens, Minister Amaraweera said the initiative will also be rolled out at State-level from MPs to Grama Seva Niladhari residences."
