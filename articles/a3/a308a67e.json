    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s parliament passed a Land Development (Amendment) Bill on Friday (11) which, according to Lands Minister S M Chandrasena, will ensure gender equality in land inheritance and reduce future disputes.",
    "The bill, introduced by Chandrasena, sought to amend the Land Development Ordinance that dates back to 1935.",
    "\u201cSince the 1935 Land Development Ordinance, it was always the oldest male child of the family that inherited land. With the passing of this amendment bill, it won\u2019t matter if the child is male or female as either genders will have the right,\u201d the minister told parliament on Friday.",
    "\u201cAfter these amendments, land cases in our country will also greatly reduce in number,\u201d he added.",
    "The amendment bill, which was passed without amendments, also proposed that \u201cthe Land Commissioner\u201d be substituted with \u201cCommissioner-General of Lands\u201d wherever those words occur in the ordinance.",
    "Other amendments include the appointment of additional land commissioners and other officials, enabling of the owner of a holding to mortgage the holding without the approval of the Divisional Secretary and prohibiting issuance of a grant for unsurveyed land. (Colombo/Mar12/2022)"
