    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka has been importing oil for many months without letters of credit helped by long term relationships, Chairman of state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Sumith Wijesinghe has said, after banks failed honor trade documents due to money printed to keep interest rates low.",

    "\u201cWe have suppliers who have worked with us for years,\u201d CPC Chairman Wijesinghe told reporters in Colombo.",
    "\u201cThere is an understanding that the ordered stocks will be purchased. When we order they have to buy it from the producer. If the CPC did not buy it, the supplier has to remove it from that point. Due to relationship we have they load the ship.\u201d",
    "Sometimes tankers wait for two weeks or more off Colombo Port waiting for letter of credit to be opened.",
    "\u201cEven if the LC was delayed they brought the ship,\u201d Wijesinghe said. \u201cUp to now we have not failed to open LC. So we still have that understanding with the suppliers.\u201d",

    "The third rate monetary policy framework eventually drove the country to default after three currency crises in quick succession.",
    "The CPC also ended up with over 3 billion US dollars in debt due to restrictions placed on dollar purchases during previous crises triggered by flexible inflation targeting.",
    "Problems state banks, partly caused by CPC dollar loans, led to progressive cuts in risk limits by foreign counterparties and country limits, long before the country officially defaulted.",
    "On April 12 Sri Lanka would not make payment on foreign debt, because the country lost the ability to do so, even though the desire to pay was there.",
