    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The\u00a0Government of Sri Lanka is fully aware of\u00a0the severe hardships of the people and its magnitude with the most pressing issues being power\u00a0cuts, shortage of gas, fuel and essential medicines, says the Minister of External Affairs, Prof. G.L. Peiris, while addressing the diplomatic corps in Colombo.",
    "In a release, the External Affairs Minister has also stated that the excessive heat which has exacerbated the\u00a0situation and the negative impact on various industries as a result due to the power cuts were also\u00a0adding to the woes of the public.",
    "He stated that the protests and the demonstrations by the people\u00a0taking place across the country was an \u201cexpression of despair\u201d and they were crying out at a\u00a0distressing situation. He also stated that 80-85% of those taking part in the protests and\u00a0demonstrations were neither extremists nor politically motivated and that Article 14 of the\u00a0Constitution of Sri Lanka guaranteed the right to assembly, freedom of expression.",
    "He further\u00a0stated that the right of the people to protest was an indication of the vibrant democracy prevailing\u00a0in Sri Lanka.",
    "Referring to violence that has taken place outside the residence of the President and Members of\u00a0Parliament during the past few days, the Minister called on the Diplomatic corps to reflect on the\u00a0gravity of these incidents and what was unfolding.",
    "External Affairs Minister Peiris stated that the protesters had exhibited an overall contempt and expressed\u00a0hatred for the entire parliamentary system and were asking all MPs to step down. The Minister\u00a0explained that the Government continues to address the issues affecting the people with other\u00a0governments and international agencies and is optimistic that the matters would eventually be",
    "Minister Peiris stated that the demonstrations were not directly against the government, a\u00a0political party or the ruling party but against the entire political establishment of the country and\u00a0that the very foundation of the system was under criticism.",
    "The Minister pointed out that some of the demands by the demonstrators were not realistic and\u00a0cannot be met and that they did not seem to want a solution based on available options in\u00a0keeping with the Constitution. He also stated that from focusing on the shortage of gas, fuel,\u00a0essential medicines and the power cuts, the protestors were now demanding for restitution of\u00a0plundered wealth and assets with some approaching the Supreme Court to prevent MPs from\u00a0leaving the country until a comprehensive audit of all their private assets was done.",
    "He further\u00a0stated that the call for all MPs to resign and allow academics and professionals to run the country\u00a0was not feasible as there was no country in the world that was governed in such a manner.",
    "The Minister of External Affairs also outlined the Constitutional provisions that were currently\u00a0available which included the Prime Minister taking over for 60 days in the event an incumbent\u00a0President resigns, after which the MPs would have to elect a suitable leader among them to lead\u00a0the country for the remaining period until an election can be held.",
    "He stated that while in some countries it was possible for the people to recall their elected\u00a0representative, that was not so in the case of Sri Lanka. He also explained the various processes\u00a0and options available under the Constitution to remove an incumbent government. The External Affairs Minister pointed out that the current government still held a majority in parliament and\u00a0that despite the agitation, there was no consensus on who can replace the current President,\u00a0Prime Minister and the Parliament.",
    "External Affairs Minister Peiris also stressed on the importance of retaining stability in the country which\u00a0was of paramount importance and added that the former Finance Minister had contacted the\u00a0International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in order to address the situation and that\u00a0the process had to move forward.",
