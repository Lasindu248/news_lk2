    "ISLAMABAD (Reuters): Imran Khan survived a move to oust him as Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister on Sunday, getting a reprieve when the Deputy Speaker of Parliament blocked a no-confidence motion as unconstitutional.",
    "Khan, whose fate was not immediately clear, advised the country\u2019s President to dissolve Parliament, leading to fresh political instability in the nuclear-armed country of 220 million people.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve sent advice to the president to dissolve assemblies,\u201d Khan said in a televised address, referring to national and state legislatures.",
    "The opposition vowed to fight the block, made by Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri of Khan\u2019s political party.",
    "\u201cWe will stage a sit-in at the National Assembly (parliament). We are also moving to the Supreme Court today,\u201d Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, head of the opposition Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP), told reporters.",
    "If the vote had gone through and the opposition remained united, the former cricket star who surged to power in 2018 but recently lost his parliamentary majority, would have been out of office.",
    "A prominent newspaper had recently said Khan was \u201cas good as gone\u201d, but he had urged his supporters to take to the streets on Sunday ahead of the planned vote."
