    "They prompted outrage in Ukraine and abroad, adding to pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by increasing the likelihood of further Western sanctions. Western nations have already sought to isolate Russia economically and punish it for the invasion, which began on Feb. 24.",

    "Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at demilitarising and \u201cdenazifying\u201d Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.",
    "On Saturday, Reuters saw bodies in a mass grave and still lying on the streets, while on Sunday the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, showed reporters two corpses with white cloth tied around their arms, one of which appeared to have been shot in the mouth.",

    "Missiles struck near the southern port of Odesa, with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military. The Odesa city council said \u201ccritical infrastructure facilities\u201d were hit.",
    "Dmytro Lunin, governor of the central Poltava region, said the Kremenchug oil refinery, 350 km (220 miles) northeast of Odesa, had been destroyed in a separate rocket attack on Saturday.",

    "Medinsky said that while Ukraine was showing more realism by agreeing to be neutral, renouncing nuclear weapons, not joining a military bloc and refusing to host military bases, there had been no progress on other key Russia demands.",
    "\u201cI repeat again and again: Russia\u2019s position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED,\u201d he said on Telegram.",
    "Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv\u2019s rule."
