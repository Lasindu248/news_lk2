    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka should tighten monetary policy to contain inflation and raise taxes to help maintain government spending, AnneMarie Gulde-Wolf tInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Acting Director for the Asia Pacific Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf said.",
    "\u201cMonetary policy has to be tightened to keep inflation in check and we see a need for a flexible exchange rate,\u201d Gulde-Wolf said.",
    "Sri Lanka has raised policy rates to 14.50 percent from 7.50 percent but data showed that money was still being printed, which will make forex shortages and currency pressure persist.",
    "Taxes also has to be raised (revenue based fiscal consolidation) to maintain government spending, she said.",
    "Sri Lanka has a large public sector and from 2015 salaries and pensions were steeply raised under \u2018revenue based fiscal spending\u2019 and total spending was raised from 17 to 20 percent of gross domestic product without substantially reducing deficits due to the lack of spending based consolidation.",
    "The collapse of Sri Lanka\u2019s flexible exchange rate, which is neither a clean float nor a hard peg has led to street protests and put the burden on adjustment mainly on the poor through sharply rising prices.",
    "\u201cWhen I says revenue based fiscal consolidation it would also mean that taxes should be paid by more that are well off and adjustment should not be forced on the most vulnerable of society,\u201d she said.",
    "The IMF encouraged Sri Lanka to default and negotiate with creditors saying the counry\u2019s debt was unsustainable."
