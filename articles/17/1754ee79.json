  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s  foreign reserves dropped 372 million US dollars to 1.9 billion US dollars as money continued to be printed to keep rates down amid a large budget deficit and looming debt repayments.",
    "Sri Lanka is following flexible inflation targeting a non-rule bound non-regime that has triggered repeated currency crises over the last 7-years including during an International Monetary Fund program.",
    "During the last IMF program a \u2018monetary policy consultation clause\u2019 was easily circumvented to trigger a currency crisis in 2018.",
    "Sri Lanka has printed large volumes of money from 2020 under Modern Monetary Theory, or post-Keynesian \u2018alternative theory\u2019 triggering the worst currency crisis in history and bringing the country to the brink of default.",
    "Foreign reserves at 1.9 billion US dollars are about 1 months of reserves. Of this about 1.6 billion US dollars is from a Chinese swap.",
    "A central bank without reserves has to float the currency and suspend convertibility.",
    "In March an attempt was made to float but the 372 million US dollar reserve loss shows that a weak side convertibility in a peg was used. There is also a strong side convertibility undertaking in the form of a surrender requirement.  (Colombo/Apr07/2022)"
