Mr. Premadasa did not wait till the end of the meeting.",
    "She discussed the need to appoint a committee to identify priorities to be done at this time because of differences among the parties opposed to the government on the way forward. The main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) insists that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa should step down as the first step to consider any interim arrangement.",
    "However, the parties and the group that declared independent of the government are not in favour of removal of the president. Also, there is no consensus among them on the next leadership in the event of the Cabinet standing dissolved or the president stepping down.",
