    "Are we getting a billion dollar loan from India? What are the conditions India is insisting on?",
    "What has a renewable energy project to be built on Delft Island to do with this? Why is President Putin insisting that the world recognizes that the whole coastline of today\u2019s Ukraine is a part of the Russian Federation? Are all these questions interconnected and if so, how and why? Here below is one man\u2019s interpretation, a man with 82 years of jam-packed knowledge!",
    "I believe our Finance Minister will get this loan if he promises to fulfil what I believe are reasonable business conditions the Indian Government is insisting on. Firstly, that Sri Lanka shows an avenue of reliable income or certain revenue preferably in a transaction between the loan giver and receiver namely India and Sri Lanka, What is more reliable than the production, sale and usage of clean renewable electricity. Sri Lanka produces it due to certain applicable advantageous conditions, India transmits and uses it and the loan is repaid on a regular basis by the revenue generated. This I believe is the way Indian thinking is centred on and I believe it will come true.",
    "Come true but how? What will be the details of this major transaction.",
    "The details are simple and straightforward but needs explanation. I have a world (PCT) patent on a method to produce electricity through compressed air which is collected by the action of breaking sea waves (surf) on the machines (WIPO PCT Patent FO3B 13/18 Application no.39440/95). This patent was acquired and shared by two major energy companies in the USA and China in early 2011 and the new machines and the method is now ready and rearing to go in 2021/2022 in order to produce clean renewable energy in enormous quantities dwarfing all other methods of generating renewable electricity.",
    "I believe that since I was born in Sri Lanka and the patent was first registered in Sri Lanka the companies concerned has offered this method to the Sri Lanka Government (GOSL) possibly as a favour and possibly due to the fact that India needs very large quantities of electrical energy.",
    "The Sri Lanka Minister of Energy, Mr. Gamini Lokuge, a short time ago revealed that a major plant of 30,000 Mw to deliver renewable and clean electricity to India was envisaged to be built on Delft Island in the north of Sri Lanka. These patented machines can very easily develop this quantum of electrical energy with the wave regime available in the north and north west of Delft Island so that a plant of 30,000 Mw capacity is not a very difficult undertaking except for the capital outlay which should be very much less than a conventional coal or LNG plant. It is assumed that the companies or company holding the patent will build at their own cost the 30,000 Mw plant on Delft Island and that some of the revenue from the sales of this electricity to India will be transferred to the GOSL enabling it to pay back the Indian loan. The electricity generated on Delft Island will be sent to Rameshwaran in South India to link up with the National Grid of India. This will be done through an undersea link financed by private transmission companies of India.",
    "Now, where does Mr.Putin President of the Russian Federation now involved in a war come in?",
    "When my patent was approved many years ago, it generated great interest in Russia and it was discussed in certain scientific journals with great alacrity and I even went to Katowice in Poland where one famous Russian scientist used to live to discuss its merits. I believe therefore very strongly that one of the main reasons for President Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine which he considers a part of Russia is to gain access to not only Odessa (as a port) but to the 2,780 km coastline of Ukraine for future renewable energy developments in which he may be interested in, in spite of Russia\u2019s great wealth in the oil and gas sector.",
    "He is insisting as a main condition of ending the war, the recognition by the whole world that the entire coastline of the present Ukraine as an integral part of the Russian Federation. The whole world was guessing at his motives for launching this war on the Ukraine.The northern coastline of Russia has very little or no breaking wave action and therefore not very suitable for energy generation. The eastern sea coast is good but far from centers of population and transmission costs will be high. The Black Sea coast is the best suited.",
    "Very very interesting (but sad times of war) we live in and I hope I will get a short time more in this life to see all these developments come true.",
