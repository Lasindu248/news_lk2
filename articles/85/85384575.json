    "COLOMBO (News 1st); Sri Lanka\u2019s Former Prime Minister and Leader of the UNP highlighted a privilege issue with regard to a Presidential Commission report.",
    "\u201cThere is a special Presidential commission appointed to investigate the \u2018Pissu Poosa\u2019 report. And the commissioners now want to question some of us including me on matters which have been discussed in the house, and proceedings of the house,\u201d he told the Parliament.",
    "Wickremesinghe, who is also the only UNP MP in Parliament said that the proceedings of the house cannot be questioned.",
    "The Former Prime Minister also noted that the said report has been challenged at the Human Rights Commission and the government must first decide whether it would accept the report or not.",
    "\u201cSecondly we have been charged as respondents. I have certainly gone to the courts and challenged this report because I was made a respondent there when I was called as a witness.,\u201d he remarked noting that the commission is not a judicial body."
