    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 \u00a0Private bus owners in Sri Lanka are on strike from midnight Thursday (05) protesting fuel shortages in the country and in support of an ongoing 24-hour islandwide \u2018hartal\u2019 on Friday (06).",
    "Two private bus owners\u2019 associations have decided to halt their services for the day.",
    "Ceylon Private Bus Owners Association told reporters on Thursday that their buses will not be operating from midnight Thursday to midnight Friday in support of the wave of protests that have erupted across Sri Lanka against the government.",
    "The Lanka Private Bus Owners\u2019 Association that accounts for 18,000 busses told EconomyNext that although they too are joining the strike Thursday midnight, they can\u2019t guarantee when they will be back to work due to ongoing fuel shortages.",
    "\u201cWe have decided to halt services from midnight today and we are asking the bus drivers who already accepted pre-bookings to cancel those tickets without creating any inconveniences,\u201d Gemunu Wijeratne, Lanka Private Bus Owners\u2019 Association (LPBOA) Chairman, said.",
    "\u201cWe are stopping services both in support of the ongoing protests and for the fuel shortage.\u201d",
    "\u201cOur main problem is the fuel. Until a solution is provided, we cannot continue the service. The hartal is only for tomorrow, but busses cannot run without fuel,\u201d said Wijeratne .",
    "Over 2,000 trade unions in Sri Lanka have called a 24-hour, island-wide hartal \u2013 in what organisers say will be the country\u2019s biggest general strike in decades \u2013 on Friday (06) in solidarity with protestors who are demanding the resignation of the government.",
    "\u2018Hartal\u2019 is an act of protests where shops and businesses stop their operation.",
    "Wijeratne said bus service operators may have to halt their services even after the hartal.",
    "He also claimed that there will be no fuel for vehicles till at least May 12. There are \u00a0already long queues for fuel since Thursday, he added.",
    "The second reason the LPBOA will be agitating for is Finance Minister Ali Sabry\u2019s comment on taxing the rich, said Wijeratne.",
    "\u201cIf they tax again, how can the people in this country live? Our spare part prices have increased by 300 percent. How can we cover that cost?\u201d he said. (Colombo/May05/2022)"
