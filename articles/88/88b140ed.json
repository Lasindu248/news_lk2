An expansion in New Orders, particularly in the manufacture of food & beverage, was witnessed in February 2022, ahead of Sinhala and Hindu New Year season.

Business Activities continued to grow in February, even though at a slower pace, with the improvements observed in several sub-sectors. Accordingly, financial services, education, professional services, other personal activities, real estate and transportation sub-sectors reported improvements during the month. In addition, business activities in accommodation, food and beverage sub-sector also recorded a marginal growth amid the steady increase in tourist arrivals despite the disturbances occurred from disruptions to fuel and electricity supplies during the latter part of the month. Nevertheless, business activities related to wholesale and retail trade sub-sector observed a deterioration during the month. Employment fell slightly in February for the first time after three months of increase due to retirements and increasing number of resignations.

Further, the uncertainities associated with fuel, electricity and LP gas supplies are also negatively affecting most of the sub-sectors.",
