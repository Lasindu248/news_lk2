  "body_lines": [
    "Uncapped Matheesha Pathirana was signed by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) season, as an injury replacement for New Zealand pace bowler Adam Milne.",
    "Pathirana, a right-arm fast bowler whose action closely resembled that of Lasith Malinga, was last season part of the CSK reserves squad along with Maheesh Theekshana, but like the mystery spinner has now been drafted into the playing squad.",
    "The Trinitian was part of Sri Lanka's squad at the Under 19 World Cup earlier this year, and despite playing just three domestic matches, has been contracted by CSK for 2 million Indian rupees, which equates to just over 8.5 million Sri Lankan rupees based on current conversion rates."
