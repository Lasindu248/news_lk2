    "The government should either resign allowing for an interim government or go for a Parliamentary election if the government and opposition MPs are not ready for an interim government, Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge said today.",
    "She said in a statement posted on social media that the peole's representatives could remain in power as long as they have people's mandate and that they should be ready to relinquish power soon after people rejected them.",
    "\"People give power to people's representatives to get their aspirations fulfilled. They should realise that the power given by the people is temporary not lifetime,\" she said.",
    "Ms Kumaratunge said she strongly condemned the moves of the government to remain in power without heeding to the strong appeal of the religious leaders including Buddhist monks, Civil Society and the general public.",
    "\"I request all people's representatives if they are unable to represent people and their objectives honestly, it is more dignified to resign from the Parliamentary seat,\" she said.",
    "\"The first is to resign the President and the government and form a stable administration in the country by strengthening the domestic economy through an interim government. And the second is, if the government and opposition MPs are not ready for it, go for a Parliamentary election and form a stable government,\" she said. (Ajith Siriwardana)"
