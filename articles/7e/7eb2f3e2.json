    "(NDTV);\u00a0Swashbuckling former all-rounder Andrew Symonds has been killed in a car crash, Cricket Australia said Sunday, in another tragic blow for the sport after the recent deaths of fellow greats Shane Warne and Rod Marsh.",
    "The 46-year-old, who played 26 Tests and 198 one-day internationals for Australia from 1998 to 2009, was involved in a single-car accident outside Townsville in Queensland state on Saturday night.",
    "Police said emergency services attempted to revive the driver and sole occupant, but he died from his injuries after the car left the road and rolled.",
    "\u201cAustralian cricket has lost another of its very best,\u201d Cricket Australia chairman Lachlan Henderson said in a statement.",
    "\u201cAndrew was a generational talent who was instrumental in Australia\u2019s success at World Cups and as part of Queensland\u2019s rich cricket history.",
    "\u201cHe was a cult figure to many who was treasured by his fans and friends,\u201d he added.",
    "Symonds\u2019 fatal crash comes just months after the deaths of fellow Australian greats Warne and Marsh, who both died unexpectedly from heart attacks.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately I\u2019ve been here too often this year under these circumstances. I actually can\u2019t quite believe it, to be honest,\u201d former Australia captain Mark Taylor told Channel Nine. \u201cAnother tragic day for cricket.\u201d",
    "The larger-than-life Symonds was hugely popular, not only for his hard-hitting approach to the game but also for his easy-going personality.",
    "He was widely considered one of the most skilled all-rounders Australian cricket has seen, bowling both off-spin and medium pace, while playing many match-winning hands with his explosive middle-order batting.",
    "Symonds was also a top-rate fielder and was a key part of Australia\u2019s back-to-back 50-over World Cups triumphs in 2003 and 2007.",
    "Domestically, he played for Queensland for 17 seasons, while appearing for Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire and Surrey in the English County Championship and for Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.",
    "\u201cHorrendous news to wake up to,\u201d tweeted former Australian teammate Jason Gillespie. \u201cUtterly devastated. We\u2019re all gonna miss you mate.\u201d",
    "Adam Gilchrist, another former teammate who more recently commentated alongside Symonds at Fox Sports, wrote: \u201cThis really hurts,\u201d while Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d.",
    "Former England skipper Michael Vaughan said: \u201cSimmo \u2026 this doesn\u2019t feel real #RIP.\u201d",
    "Symonds, who was born in England with one parent of Afro-Caribbean descent, will also be remembered for the infamous \u201cmonkeygate\u201d scandal that sent him into a downward spiral.",
    "He accused India spinner Harbhajan Singh of calling him a \u201cmonkey\u201d in Sydney\u2019s 2008 New Year Test.",
    "Singh, who denied any wrongdoing, was suspended for three matches. The ban was overturned when India threatened to quit the tour in a low point for India-Australia cricket relations.",
    "\u201cFrom that moment on that was my downhill slide,\u201d he recalled in 2018. \u201cI started to drink heavily as a result of it and my life was starting to dissolve around me.\u201d",
    "His Cricket Australia contract was withdrawn in June 2009 after he was sent home from the World Twenty20 in England following the latest in a series of alcohol-related indiscretions.",
    "Nearly 90 arrested in connection with 9th May events: Police"
