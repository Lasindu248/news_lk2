    "Discussing the new offsite access point, SVP \u2013 Head of Retail Banking and SME, Aasiri Iddamalgoda said, \u201cThe Templeburg Industrial Zone is a major complex that houses 34 companies and thousands of employees. We understood that many people face difficulties inconveniently accessing financial services, while also requiring access to cash services. It also came to our attention that productivity was being affected as individuals had to take a short leave to perform their banking activities. Thus, as the Bank for Everyone, we saw an opportunity to not just provide convenient access to digital and cash banking services, but also to increase financial inclusivity, in line with our 2030 sustainability goals. Thus, we are very pleased to empower the companies and workers in the zone, along with the public in the area, through our new offsite cash-deposit capable ATM and digital payment kiosk \u201cPay & Go\u201d at the Templeburg Industrial Zone. We are also supporting businesses through DFCC iConnect, our class-leading comprehensive digital cash management solution, and other SME banking products.\u201d",
