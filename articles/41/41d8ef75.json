Meanwhile, the UGC, which oversees all higher educational institutions in Sri Lanka, has recently put in place additional regulations aimed at preventing harassment of students by their seniors. accordingly, the university authorities are now required to report such incidents to the police, and those found guilty of the offenses are liable to lengthy imprisonment, expulsion from the institution of higher education, and payment for damages suffered by the victim. An additional stipulation is that all students pledge in writing that they will not engage in harassment of the new entrants. (SHEAIN FERNANDOPULLE)"
