    "Whilst stressing the need for restructuring key government institutions such as Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and national carrier SriLankan Airlines, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) today said it will support such restructuring processes.",
    "SJB Puttalam District MP Niroshan Perera told a press conference that key government institutions should be restructured as they are a burden to the people who are already battered. \u201cWe stress that the government should go for a restructuring process as soon as possible to ease the burden on the people,\u201d the MP said. Asked whether SJB would support a restructuring process, the MP said his party will support such a programme.",
    "The MP added that Sri Lanka is about to face a diplomatic crisis with the refusal by China for a currency SWAP, while ties with Russia had become doubtful following the Aeroflot drama. \u201cThe comments made by the CEB Chief could upset India as well,\u201d he said.",
    "Also he said it is evident that Sri Lanka\u2019s situation had got worse with the appeal made by the UN to the world on June 9 that Sri Lanka needs emergency humanitarian assistance.",
    "He said it was revealed at the meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) that Sri Lanka still needs to import 35,000 MT of red dhal, 540,000 MT of sugar, 1.1 million MT of wheat flour, 120,000 metric tons of potatoes and 36 000 MT of canned fish annually. \u201cThe issue is to find dollars to pay for these imports.
