    "(Reuters) \u2013 India is willing to commit up to another $2 billion in financial assistance to Sri Lanka while also supporting the island nation with food and fuel, five sources told Reuters, as New Delhi tries to regain ground lost to China in recent years.",
    "Sri Lanka, hit by its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 and on the brink of its first debt default, has been asking friendly nations including India and China for credit lines, food and energy. The Asian giants have already committed billions of dollars in financial support.",
    "\u201cWe are definitely looking to help them out and are willing to offer more swap lines and loans,\u201d said an Indian source aware of various discussions with Sri Lanka.",
    "A senior government source in New Delhi said Sri Lanka\u2019s warning on Tuesday of defaulting on debt payments was a worry, but that \u201cwe can still give them up to $2 billion in swaps and support\u201d",
    "Another source familiar with Sri Lanka\u2019s thinking said it was seeking India\u2019s help to roll over some $2 billion in dues, such as those owed to the South Asia-focussed Asian Clearing Union. The source said the response had been positive from India.",
    "All the sources had direct knowledge of the matter or had been briefed on it, but they declined to be named as the discussions were private.",
    "India\u2019s government and its central bank, as well as Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign and finance ministries, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
    "India has so far committed $1.9 billion to Sri Lanka in loans, credit lines and currency swaps. Sri Lanka has also sought another $500 million credit line for fuel.",
    "China has extended a $1.3 billion syndicated loan and a $1.5 billion-yuan denominated swap, while negotiations are ongoing for more loans and credit lines.",
    "One of the sources said New Delhi was keen for its southern neighbour to cut its reliance on China. Sri Lanka has an outstanding debt of about $3.5 billion with China \u2013 or 10.8% of the island\u2019s total \u2013 and Beijing has also built ports and roads in the country.",
    "\u201cWe want them to reduce their debt levels from China and we want to become stronger partners,\u201d said the source.",
