  "body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka Customs Officers\u2019 Union yesterday called on the Government to ensure political stability, whilst insisting suppression of peaceful protests and right to freedom of expression will tarnish the country\u2019s image in the international arena.",
    "\u201cIf the current situation prevails for longer with no solution, we observe it will create uncertainty about future, which will impact trade and complete economic peril. Thus, implementing a sustainable economic revival plan, whilst ensuring political stability is critical,\u201d they said.",
    "They also claimed that the dire economic conditions that the people are faced with is a reflection of the short-sighted economic and fiscal policies of the Government.",
    "\u201cForeseeing the current economic situation, we as an organisation presented a reasonable proposal to the President and the former Finance Minister and former Secretary to the President. But our recommendations were thrown to the dustbin without even having a look at it by the former Secretary to the President,\u201d they pointed out.",
    "They said that it was not just their proposals, but many such submissions made by several such associations were turned a blind eye by successive Governments over the past two decades.",
    "The Customs Officers\u2019 Union charged that the economists that were behind those decision making should be held accountable for the prevailing status of the economy."
