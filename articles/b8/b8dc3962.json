    "Recognising that \u201ctiming is key\u201d for Sri Lanka as it tries to cope with a grave economic crisis, the Indian system is working \u201covertime\u201d to expedite its assistance to the island nation, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on March 30, wrapping up his visit to the island nation.",
    "\u201cIn a situation like this, things cannot be done at a normal pace. Everything must be fast-tracked. Our system is working overtime. What would have taken weeks earlier is now taking days,\u201d he said, adding that the recently finalised Indian credit line of $1 billion for essential imports would be operationalised \u201cvery soon.\u201d",
    "Briefing Colombo-based Indian journalists ahead of his departure to New Delhi, the EAM \u2014 who was in Colombo to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) summit \u2014 said India may not be Sri Lanka\u2019s top creditor but is the country\u2019s closest neighbour.",
    "\u201cWe are approaching it [Sri Lankan crisis] like a sensible, good neighbour, keeping politics out of it,\u201d he said, pointing to the $400 million RBI currency swap, the $500 million loan deferment, $500 million credit line for fuel, and the more recent billion-dollar credit line that New Delhi has extended or facilitated this year.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we stepped up like this for any country. We have helped countries during natural disasters or the pandemic. But this is different,\u201d he said, admitting Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cneeds are more.\u201d",
    "Recent bilateral agreements, including for private sector investment from India, had \u201cstrengthened Sri Lanka\u2019s overall position,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar observed. \u201cThat Sri Lanka\u2019s closest neighbour is investing as much here is a statement in itself.\u201d",
    "Since January, India has signed several long-negotiated agreements, including the joint development of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farms, and energy projects in the north and east to be set up by the National Thermal Power Corporation and the Adani Group.",
    "The slew of agreements, which some commentators in Sri Lanka have linked to Indian financial assistance, suggests a shift from the time Mr. Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka last, in early 2021. The \u201cslow-paced\u201d progress in India-backed projects had dominated most discussions then. \u201cToday there is a sense of collaboration and cooperation,\u201d he said.",
    "All the same, Sri Lanka\u2019s political Opposition has questioned the Adani Group\u2019s \u201cbackdoor entry\u201d into the island\u2019s energy sector, rather than through the competitive bidding process mandated by Sri Lanka\u2019s energy laws.",
    "Asked about the emerging criticism, Mr. Jaishankar said: \u201cWe [Indian government] don\u2019t get into private sector investment here. The development of the Trincomalee Farms is based on an intergovernmental understanding. NTPC is a PSU. G2B (Government to business) is their [Sri Lanka\u2019s] business. Maybe they\u2019re looking to shore up investor confidence here,\u201d he said.",
    "During his visit, the EAM held talks with the Sri Lankan leadership, senior ministers and key members of the Opposition. While a \u201cbulk\u201d of his bilateral meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa focused on the economy, several other matters of mutual interest were briefly discussed, the EAM said. This included the President\u2019s account of his recent talks with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), representing war-affected Tamils of the north and east. Later, a TNA delegation too briefed the visiting Indian official of the interaction.",
    "\u201cFour specific issues \u2013 the release of political prisoners, land, missing persons and development have come up in their discussion. These have concerned the Tamils for a long time now. Both sides have identified and agreed upon specific, actionable points. Since there is prospect of movement, we think it is a good idea to pursue those,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said.",
    "\u201cAction on these issues could have an impact on reconciliation and trust building. But that is not the end of the conversation,\u201d he added, referring to the pending political solution.",
    "India officially \u201cwelcomed\u201d the talks in a statement on Monday.",
    "Further, the Minister congratulated Sri Lanka for successfully hosting the BIMSTEC summit amid challenges of the pandemic. \u201cAfter 25 years, the BIMSTEC charter is done, and there is a formal organisational structure now. This is important as SAARC is stuck because of Pakistan,\u201d he said.",
    "Members had also formalised a \u201cmaster plan for connectivity,\u201d he noted, terming the developments \u201ca big step in improving the effectiveness and weight\u201d of BIMSTEC."
