    "Following a Court order, the Ministry of Health last week paid overdue wages of Dr. Shafi who in turn said will donate the funds to Kurunegala Teaching Hospital to buy urgent medicines, sending a strong message to racists and crooks who framed baseless allegation that he performed illegal sterilisation operations at his workplace the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.",

    "On Monday, former President Kumaratunga in a Twitter message said: \u201cA shameful Chapter of Sinhala extremism clothed in lies, jealousy and hatred has ruined the life of a good professional. Congratulations Dr.Safi for your response to the hatred spewed at you. All right-thinking Sinhala citizens pay homage to you.\u201d",

    "On his part Dr. Shafi said the character assignation suffered by him was unprecedented and racism will not take a country or organisation forward except make poor people suffer more. \u201cTherefore, we all must help to make Sri Lanka a racism-free nation,\u201d he added.",
    "He said despite the racist attacks and accusations he bears no hatred towards anyone, nor does he curse anyone. But he urged all not to attack professionals and people with a racist attitude or baseless allegations.",
    "After being cleared by the Court, Dr. Shafi was reinstated subsequently. The payment of Rs. 2.6 million included the basic salary, interim allowance, cost of living, and allowance in lieu of pension for the period of compulsory leave imposed on Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen."
