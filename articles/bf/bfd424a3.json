    "Addressing the media, he said the Chief prelates called upon the President, Prime Minister, the Opposition Leader and all the Parliamentarians to implement the proposals put forward by them on April 4 to resolve the present crisis in the country.",
    "The Mahanayake Theras also issued a warning that a \"Sangha Convention\" would be convened if the political leadership fails to act on the proposals, he said.",
    "We don't have any other options besides where the people are going through. The bus industry is also suffering, as the whole country's economic woes are looming. When considering all facts, we also see that this government is unable to move forward to which they do not have any proper plan to restore the its economy,\" Wijerathe said.",
    "\"The country is currently lacking essentials such as gas, fuel, foodstuff and medicine. With the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, the price of goods are going up without any control. All these are controlled by the black market.
