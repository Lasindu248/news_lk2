    "Over the weekend the PUCSL increased the power cuts after demand went up. The regulator has not yet given a price increase for power and people are shifting to electricity as gas prices went up and shortages emerged.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing forex shortages due to money printed to keep interest rates low and the country has run out of reserves and the currency has been floated.",
    "However, the float has not yet taken place and the rupee has fallen from 203 to 275 to the dollar and prices are getting validated at that level. (Colombo/March28/2022)"
