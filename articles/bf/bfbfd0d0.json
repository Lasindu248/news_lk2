    "COLOMBO (News 1st); The\u00a0 Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has issued a statement regarding the imposition of the State of Emergency, mentioning that it is deeply concerned by\u00a0the President\u2019s decision to declare a State of Emergency under section 2 of the Public Security\u00a0Ordinance (PSO) with effect on the 6th of May.",
    "Pointing out that this is\u00a0the second time the President has declared a State of Emergency in the span of five weeks with no\u00a0credible justification provided, in a context when Sri Lanka has witnessed weeks-long peaceful protests across the island, CPA states that despite the peaceful citizen mobilisation, CPA is alarmed by the violent and intimidatory tactics used by authorities, with the declaration of state of emergency being the latest\u00a0move to crush dissent and other democratic rights.",
