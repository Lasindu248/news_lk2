    "\u201cWe shall officially announce our decision to give an ultimatum of one month to the government and our decision to go for Arab Spring type of protest during the protest fixed for Tuesday. We will come to Colombo and march in search of the President. We will march towards wherever the President will be and give him an ultimatum,\u201d the MP said.",
    "\u201cWe invite all parties including the JVP to join us without criticizing us,\u201d he added.",
