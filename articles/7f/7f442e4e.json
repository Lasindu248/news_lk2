    "A tense situation erupted at the CEYPETCO Petrol Filling Station in Town Hall today when angry consumers who were lined up for hours demanded for fuel despite the ongoing shortage. Police rushed to the area and security was heightened as officers tried to calm the frustration and anger of the consumers. The matter was eventually sorted and people were informed that fuel was running low at the Filling Station and no new stocks had been received. Pix by Waruna Wanniarachchi"
