    "CSE operations halted due to the S and P SL20 index slipping over 5 per cent yesterday as economic uncertainties grew in tandem with speculation that arose over the weekend about another fuel price hike and major price rises in essential consumer items, stock market analysts said.",
    "Amid those developments, trading halted half an hour before closing time, which was around 12 noon. The reasons being that the market feels there is insufficient communication on the IMF program, besides global oil prices moving up. It is believed there could be a fresh series of fuel price hikes, thereby triggering commodity price rises that in turn could create a drop in investor sentiment. Further, certain issues and the opposition triggered by SLPP MPs in parliament to the passing of the 21 st Amendment to the Constitution, add insult to injury, analysts explained.",

Sri Lanka\u2019s inflation in April is already at 39.1 per cent and if it moves beyond 50 percent the country will be facing hyperinflation, which is also a major worry.",
