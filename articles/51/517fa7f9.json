    "Former President Maithripala Sirisena today strongly rejected the allegation made by Wasantha Samarasinghe, the convener of the Voice Against Corruption, that a portion of the money allegedly stolen from the Central Bank bond fraud had been given to former President Maithripala Sirisena and his family members.",
    "In a media release, the former President\u2019s private secretary Sameera de Silva stated that \u201cBlaming innocent people without any basis for political gain was not a moral political act and that all possible action would be taken in the future regarding this malicious statement.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is a completely untrue statement and the commitment of former President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Fraud and a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Forensic Audit and to investigate the Central Bank Bond Fraud is a fact that is appreciated by many and it is a matter of respect at home and abroad,\u201d the statement added."
