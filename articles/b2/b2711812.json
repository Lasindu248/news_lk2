    "Government Medical Officers\u2019 Association members engaged in anti-government protest last week \u2013 Reuters",
    "REUTERS: Rosanne White was first diagnosed with cancer eight years ago and lost a kidney. After the cancer returned five years ago, an oncologist in Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital Colombo started her on Bevacizumab last May, a treatment she was responding to.",
    "White, a 58-year-old Sri Lankan retiree, said she had received the injections free of charge as part of the country\u2019s universal government health system, which the vast majority of its 22 million people depend on.",
    "But after 13 rounds of treatment, White said she now cannot find the injection in Government hospitals.",
    "Bevacizumab costs Rs. 113,000 ($ 359) per shot in the private market and, because she does not have insurance, White said the costs were eating into her limited savings.",
    "\u201cWe have to call the hospital before going in for treatment to find out if our medication is available,\u201d White told Reuters. \u201cBut what do you do when the nurses say the hospital doesn\u2019t have the medication?\u201d",
    "White\u2019s struggle to find Bevacizumab in state-run facilities is an early sign of how Sri Lanka\u2019s healthcare system is close to collapse, under the weight of the island nation\u2019s worst economic crisis. As well as shortages of vital drugs, some procedures and tests have been suspended.",
    "The lack of foreign exchange has left President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s Government unable to import essentials including medicines and fuel, causing crippling power cuts and bringing thousands of protesters on to the streets demanding his ouster.",
    "Reuters spoke to two Government officials, six doctors and a healthcare union leader who said they had not seen Sri Lanka\u2019s health system in such a bad way before.",
    "An internal memo from a major State-run hospital in Colombo seen by Reuters said that only emergency, casualty and malignancy surgeries would be conducted from 7 April onwards because of a lack of surgical supplies.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s health ministry did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the problems facing the sector.",
    "The economy, which relies heavily on tourism, has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and hit by the sharp rise in oil prices in the wake of the war in Ukraine, which has made importing enough fuel unaffordable.",
    "Some analysts have also criticised Rajapaksa\u2019s administration for its decision in 2019 to make deep tax cuts and delay talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Those negotiations are now going ahead.",
    "A close aide to the Rajapaksas has said previously that the tax cuts had been designed to boost the economy, but that COVID-19 then struck.",
    "Sri Lanka now has just $ 1.93 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the equivalent of less than a month\u2019s imports, while Government debt repayments of twice that amount are due in 2022.",
    "The Sri Lanka Medical Association, the country\u2019s oldest professional medical body, wrote to Rajapaksa last week warning him that even emergency treatments may have to be stopped in the coming days.",
    "\u201cThis will result in a catastrophic number of deaths,\u201d the association said.",
    "In late March, a 70-year-old woman was wheeled into a Government-backed tertiary care hospital in a Colombo suburb. The patient was in septic shock, leading to dangerously low blood pressure.",
    "The doctor dealing with the emergency said the patient ideally needed to be injected with albumin.",
    "\u201cIn this case, it wasn\u2019t available,\u201d said the doctor, who declined to be identified because hospital medical staff are not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cWhich means I lost a crucial five minutes.\u201d The patient died, the doctor said.",
    "Out of 1,325 drugs that the government provides to State-run hospitals, three life-saving medicines have completely run out and another 140 essential ones are in short supply, the secretary to Sri Lanka\u2019s pharmaceuticals ministry said.",
    "\u201cThis will not end in two months,\u201d Saman Rathnayake told Reuters. \u201cThe dollar crisis will go on.\u201d But he added that new sources of supply could help alleviate immediate shortages.",
    "Some medicines ordered through a credit line with neighbouring India, which supplies 80% of the island\u2019s requirement, would likely arrive within two weeks.",
    "\u201cIf this Indian credit line works, there won\u2019t be an issue for the next six months,\u201d Rathnayake said.",
    "Beyond that, Sri Lanka has sought help from the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. \u201cTheir things will come after six months,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how we\u2019ve planned.\u201d Desperate for supplies, some doctors\u2019 groups have made public appeals for donations.",
    "Running out of endotracheal (ET) tubes used to help new-born infants with respiratory distress, the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka issued a list of supplies that can be donated via the health ministry.",
    "\u201cWe have almost used all the stocks and no ET tubes will be available in few weeks,\u201d the society\u2019s president Saman Kumara said in a letter shared on social media.",
    "\u201cI have instructed (staff) not to discard used ET tubes but to clean and sterilise them from now onwards as we may have to reuse them.\u201d A list of out-of-stock supplies from the major state-run hospital in southern Colombo seen by Reuters featured more than 40 items, including urethral catheters, different types of tubes, umbilical cord clamps and glucose test strips used for checking blood sugar levels.",
    "A crowd of patients waited on plastic chairs and wooden benches inside a large, brightly lit hall at a major Government hospital in northern Colombo late last week.",
    "The hospital, which records around 50,000 patient visits every month with a staff of just over 2,500, is one of the country\u2019s major urban health facilities that serves multiple districts, an official said.",
    "\u201cWe are still fighting,\u201d the official said, asking that he and the hospital not be named. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how long we can maintain services.\u201d Last August, as early signs of a brewing crisis became clear, the official said the hospital stopped infrastructure improvements and major renovations, diverting the money to shore up medical supplies.",
    "In recent weeks, after Sri Lanka devalued its currency amid soaring inflation, the official said the cost of medical supplies had increased by 30-40% and put further pressure on the finances of the hospital, already some Rs. 350 million ($ 1.11 million) in debt.",
    "Overall, the government owed around Rs. 4 billion ($ 12.70 million) to suppliers of items such as gloves and reagents used for medical testing, said Rathnayake from the pharmaceutical ministry.",
    "Ravi Kumudesh, president of the Medical Laboratory Technologists Association, said testing had dropped by 30%, with some high-end tests completely stopped. Maintenance of equipment like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines has also been delayed.",
    "\u201cThere is a gap between the treatment a patient should be getting and what they are getting,\u201d Kumudesh told Reuters.",
    "\u201cNo one is being held accountable. Even though we are not calculating the numbers, people are dying,\u201d he said.",
    "In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Sri Lanka\u2019s new Finance Minister Ali Sabry said his first priority was to stabilise the supply of essentials such as medicines.",
    "But for patients like White, coping with the crisis is becoming increasingly difficult. Slow-release morphine tablets to manage pain are often not available, she said.",
    "\u201cThe other day my son went to get it and came back empty-handed,\u201d White said."
