    "The funds raised through the IPO will be utilised to expand the Company\u2019s branch network by setting up three branches in 2022, build capacity by investing on novel equipment/technology and improve the vehicle fleet in its existing branches in Colombo and Kandy. The company plans to setup a premier 24\u00d77 customer care and retail center to market internationally renowned energy saving, non-chemical pest management, health and safety brands. The funds will also be utilised to expand local manufacturing by further investing in \u2018Made in Sri Lanka\u2019 products to contribute mitigating the out-flow of foreign exchange from our country.",

    "\u201cListing on the Colombo Stock Exchange will be an important milestone and it will help us achieve our mid-term strategic objectives in diversifying our business beyond pest management and to create an \u2018Environmental Enhancement Technology Brand\u2019. Being a listed entity will mitigate the challenges we face to move across borders in expanding our business in the emerging world via fully or partly owned branches and/or international franchising network in South Asia, South & East Africa, Middle East, Indian & Pacific Island nations. The company plans to commence its Maldives operations in 2022, Seychelles and Botswana in 2023.\u201d Marlon Ferreira Founder/Managing Director stated.",
