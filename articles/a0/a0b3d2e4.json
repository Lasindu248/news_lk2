    "All political parties should focus on establishing a joint framework to ensure the availability of essential items rather than playing political games with the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena said today.",
    "\u201cParliament should meet day and night daily and prepare a framework agreeable to all parties to ensure the availability of essential items. What people want is gas, petrol, diesel and food rather than the 21st Amendment,\u201d Mr. Abeywardena said.",
    "\u201cThe framework for economic stability should be coupled with constitutional reforms,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cExecutive Presidency cannot be abolished now because of the constitutional provisions that it should be done through a referendum. However an opportunity of abolishing it was lost in 2019 as the cabinet was divided. Some Ministers who represent the cabinet of 2015 did not want the Executive Presidency abolished saying the presidential elections should be held as there is an opportunity of a UNPer getting elected as the executive president,\u201d he said.",
    "Asked whether any leader who represents any political party is currently trying to go against his followers, Mr. Abeywardena said the whole population should go against such a leader if he is deceiving his followers. (Yohan Perera)"
