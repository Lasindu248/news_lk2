    "Suzi Fluckiger is well-known for her singing and entertaining capabilities and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been writing about, in my articles.",
    "Even in Switzerland, where she is now based, they love her for her music, and her bubbly personality.",
    "However, it was a totally different scene, just recently, when the spotlight was focused on her.",
    "No, it wasn\u2019t for her talent, as her singer, but\u2026yes, a tennis player! Hard to believe, right!",
    "Suzi, I\u2019m told, does play tennis, on a regular basis, just to keep herself fit. But\u2026she turned out to be a winner at a Swiss tournament, held recently.",
    "Sharing her happiness, on social media, she had this to say: \u201cOmg, can\u2019t believe that this small, fatty, but strong Sri Lankan girl, made it to win a silver medal at the Swiss Tennis Championship, today (March 06).",
    "In the meanwhile, the music scene, in Switzerland, has been relatively quiet, the past few months, due to winter, says Suzi, adding that things are beginning to brighten up.",
    "\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m almost fully booked for the month of April.\u201d",
    "There is also a possibility of Suzi doing a couple of special shows, in her land of birth, Sri Lanka, before the year is out.",
