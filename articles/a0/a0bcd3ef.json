    "The attack followed Thursday\u2019s sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet.",
    "Ukraine said one of its missiles had caused the Moskva to sink, a powerful symbol of its resistance to a better-armed foe. Moscow said the ship sank while being towed in stormy seas after a fire caused by an explosion of ammunition and that more than 500 sailors were evacuated.",
    "The United States believes the Moskva was hit by two Ukrainian missiles and that there were Russian casualties, although numbers were unclear, a senior U.S. official said.",
    "Ukraine\u2019s military said on Saturday the presence of Russian warships in the Black Sea, armed with sea-launched missiles, suggests that an increased possibility that Russia would use them to strike Ukraine\u2019s defence industry and logistics infrastructure.",
    "It said also that Russia\u2019s navy was active in the Sea of Azov to block the port of Mariupol, where ground fighting has intensified as Ukraine said it was trying to break Russia\u2019s siege.",
    "Home to 400,000 people before Russia\u2019s invasion, Mariupol has been reduced to rubble. Thousands of civilians have died and tens of thousands remain trapped.",
    "\u201cThe situation in Mariupol is difficult and hard. Fighting is happening right now. The Russian army is constantly calling on additional units to storm the city,\u201d defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a briefing. He said the Russians have not completely captured it.",
    "Zelenskiy said the military situation in the south and east was \u201cstill very difficult,\u201d while praising the work of his armed forces.",
    "\u201cThe successes of our military on the battlefield are really significant, historically significant. But they are still not enough to clean our land of the occupiers. We will beat them some more,\u201d he said in a late-night video address, calling again for allies to send heavier weapons and for an international embargo on Russian oil.",
    "Zelenskiy has appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden for the United States to designate Russia a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism,\u201d joining North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Syria, the Washington Post reported, citing people familiar with their conversation. read more",
    "A White House spokesperson responded by saying, \u201cWe will continue to consider all options to increase the pressure on Putin.\u201d",

    "If Moscow captures Mariupol, it would be the first big city to fall.",
    "Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had captured the city\u2019s Illich steel works. The report could not be confirmed. Ukrainian defenders are mainly believed to be holding out in Azovstal, another huge steel works. read more",

    "Moscow has used its naval power to blockade Ukrainian ports and threaten a potential amphibious landing along the coast. Without the Moskva, the largest warship sunk during conflict since Argentina\u2019s General Belgrano in the 1982 Falklands war, its ability to menace Ukraine from the sea could be crippled.",
    "Russia initially described its aims in Ukraine as \u201ca special military operation\u201d to disarm its neighbour and defeat nationalists there.",
    "After its invasion force was driven from the outskirts of Kyiv this month, Moscow has said its main war aim is to capture the Donbas, the eastern region partly held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.",
    "Kyiv and its Western allies say those are bogus justifications for an unprovoked war of aggression that has driven a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s 44 million people from their homes and led to the deaths of thousands."
