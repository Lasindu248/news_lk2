    "Sri Lanka is suffering from highly unstable socioeconomic, political, and cultural backwardness due to mismanagement of these sectors by the politicians, administrators, lawmakers, policymakers, intellectuals, religious leaders, and a good number of reckless citizens of the country. This situation is not a thing that erupted in the recent past. Its roots have been linked for many decades. Starting from \u201871 abortive insurrections by the JVPers, Tamil\u2019s uprising and terrorism in three decades, 88/89 JVPers second abortive insurrection, and present calamity by youths are some critical incidents. The present calamity has some roots in JVPers as well as the JVP fraction political movement, which is Peratugami, but it needs time to claim who made a significant contribution and to what scale they have been managed pressure against the present political authority. Apart from these segments, which are active in the present calamity, there are several other fractions making a silent contribution. In addition, the actual suppressed citizens are taking the responsibility to discharge the aggression at the highest level.",
    "It is very clear that all of these conflicts are generated by the youths due to the pressure erupted in society. The root causes are linked with famous political characters in major and minor political parties. As highlighted above, the responsible and accountable segments of the society have not been done their role even in all post-calamitous and conflict situations. In \u201871, all culprits were put into jail. Tamil uprising and terrorism controlled by the war and some political solutions, but as a country, all ethnic and religious groups have suffered a lot. A committee appointed to study the lesson learnt was not a comprehensive and practicable platform to identify real issues of the conflict. Also, it did not identify and implement effectively and efficiently. 88/89 insurrection ended up with the youth commission, and it identified certain sustainable solutions. However, some politicians openly violated these commonly accepted solutions, such as qualifying examinations for jobs and other common opportunities in society. The commission report suggested a reasonable percentage for all political platforms providing opportunities for the youths. When these suggestions are not been implemented, the youths have been frustrated again. If the responsible members have implemented a good rehabilitation process and provide opportunities for youths, we don\u2019t face a highly critical\u00a0political crisis today.",
    "The present calamity is also generated by the frustrated youths who have been having political affiliations to some political parties, as highlighted above, and some of them are not, but they discharged their frustration based on the situational conditions. Especially, they have been suffering from socioeconomic and psychological reasons generated due to Covid and the economic crisis in the country. The economic crisis is purely an issue created by the political characters, administrators of the government, and eminent gatekeepers in the legal system. Especially, turning law and order (Neethiya Navima) is a very critical factor that stood behind the present calamity in the country. The legal experts have been extended the fullest cooperation to the corrupted politicians who are involved in these bad practices. The political fragmentation has further aggravated this situation with some overseas and domestic assistance.",
    "As a country which is having long historical roots in democracy, Sri Lanka has a well-established legal system that can be used to govern the country. However, it never says that the legal system supported by the constitution is comprehensive. Mainly, the constitution is not highlighting a retirement age for politicians. The current assembly is highly equipped with elderly politicians who are inefficient, ineffective, and unskilled. They are equipped with several negative social values such as reluctance to change, land and place attachment, family attachment, etc. The present constitution does not have any qualification for engagement in politics. This is a matter of democracy, but the majority of civilians have basic and secondary educational qualifications that can be fixed to a certain minimum set of qualifications. Pakistan introduced a bachelor\u2019s degree as an educational qualification for a cabinet minister. As we identified, there are a good number of politicians who are entrusting that they could get a seat in the parliament if they spent 800 million in the election. They do not need any relationship to the locality. As parachute members, they can get a chance in the parliament. Then, where is democracy? In addition, their pedigree and kinship network, and social network are added qualifications to become a member of the parliament. Especially, the current constitution is amended with a 2/3 majority to fulfil political party needs. The present government changed the constitution as per their own shake, neglecting the civilians, other parties, and social organisation\u2019s needs. The latest constitution amendment allowed dual citizens to be in politics enabling the most corrupted political character/s. President Gotabaya gave up his American citizenship, but he facilitated his brother Basil to be in the parliament. The most popular former president and most unpopular ex-prime minister made an enormous effort to give chances to his sons in politics in the country. Thus, these are certain gaps in our constitution, and they should be defined in co-operate aspect rather than the individual aspect.",
    "The politicisation of rural masses was initiated in the early 70s by introducing amendments to the agrarian laws of the country. Then, in 1977, the UNP government ensured five job card systems to each Grama Sevaka Division. The agriculture officer is the first political appointment introduced by them. These acts initiated political fragmentation among civilians resulting disintegration of the sociocultural base of the country. Gradually, the political party in power has contributed to the political fragmentation and disintegration on each occasion. The gatekeepers of each village cluster have gradually destroyed social harmony. All political allies at the village level made a significant contribution to this situation. It is represented by religious leaders, government officers, intellectuals and traditional leaders.",
    "Sri Lanka Administrative Service is the most powerful professional organisation that can direct the country on the right track. As most of the critiques highlighted, early CAS officers are more perfect than the present SLAS officers is a myth. Society is always changing, and they have been mixed with dirty politicians to support and protect them in various manners. The mismanagement of SLAS officers in their domain and apathy, and lack of confidence to act according to the law and order and policies made a huge impact on the present crisis in the country. It is evident that some of them are going behind the politicians to get job opportunities. In addition, they lack skills, particularly language competency. Thus, most of them are not getting a thorough knowledge and training in the profession. Ultimately, they have to listen to the politicians and the upper hierarchy of their service. Some of the upper hierarchy are violating the profession and the laws and regulations. A most influential character in conducting elections in order to maintain law and order has violated the law by putting his daughter\u2019s name into the electorate list in the recent past. He influenced the Assistant Commissioner to act accordingly. Once the Asst. Commissioner rejected the unlawful act, he was transferred and replaced with a new one to achieve his target. Another such officer liable for auditing was managing a company while being in the position. It is very pathetic to see such characters because they are using social media to keep their popularity among the citizens. They do lots of show-off cases to cover up these incidents. In the meantime, they misused government properties and mismanaged the system. When they behave in this manner, the only solution is political affiliations for survival. Then, how do we maintain a systematic administration in the country? Especially the politicians are grabbing these opportunities to achieve their targets, even violating law and order. When both segments are corrupted, there is no transparency and order in the system. Thus, if they do the right and correct thing, corrupted politicians, cannot",
    "The majority of SLAS officers\u2019 main goal is to become a secretary of a ministry or other organisation. Because it provides the maximum benefits during the service, and finally, they can get a V8 at retirement or a 100 % free vehicle permit. It is making a huge wealth for them, and they can use it for their betterment. Thus, political affiliation, partial service, and gaining benefits through the governing political authority is a common practice in the present Sri Lankan society. If these officers do not accept and liaise with the key and regional politicians, they do not get any benefit in the service. They need to do a favour to win the politicians in the governing party; these acts are dismantling the system. Ultimately, the civilians do not respect and trust the administrative system. In addition, there are many other psychosocial factors that the subordinate characters are leading the governing factors in the institution.",
    "Religious leaders are the most crucial factor in Sri Lankan politics today. A few decades back, the Buddhist monks became influential characters in politics. In the meantime, the Cardinal\u2019s involvement in politics has become a recent trend in the country. In the beginning, he was very transparent and acted in order to achieve the common truth and justice. However, his behaviour has changed drastically in the recent past, and subordinate priests also show the same trend. The politicisation of the Cardinal\u2019s behaviour made a significant impact on the present calamity. He is responsible for the aggressive behaviour of protesters. His liberal and unbiased character has disappeared now. The Buddhist monks and their biased political behaviour created a real pessimistic ideology among many segments of the country. They have changed their ideal role and adhered to unacceptable political affiliations and involvements in party politics. Usually, these religious leaders are the powerful element that they can inculcate new social values among the disciples. Apart from adhering to the Prathimoksha and other guidance, they have gradually adhered to the common social life, which is no difference at all when compared with civilians. They are addicted to many unaccepted behaviours, including alcohol and cohabitation. Now, there is no common property among them, and they follow private property ownership. A most powerful monk who is showing that he is the guardian of Mahabodhi acts against the Buddhist Philosophy and transfers temple lands to non-Buddhist critical elements in the country. This unethical and unaccepted behaviour of monks is very common in the significant monastery to the village temple today. Many monks are money makers, and they don\u2019t do their prime role. Especially, they cannot live and survive without politicians, which is a pathetic condition in our grade tradition. When the grade tradition ruins, there will be no common culture and integrity. It seems that disciples are more religious than religious leaders. As a gatekeeper, they are the most appropriate character that the Sri Lankan culture could enrich. However, it is the only thing that they are not doing. The rationality disappeared, and old and new irrational beliefs were established.",
    "The number of universities and the number of intakes has increased dramatically compared to Sri Lankan universities\u2019 early stage. Each university\u2019s output per year has been over a thousand graduands in the recent past. Are they really act and do their role for self and national development? The answer is no. What is the reason behind it? Most undergraduates lack life skills, interpersonal skills, leadership skills, communication skills, language competencies, etc. Students\u2019 politics are in a critical stage; they do all national interests but have no direct inputs for quality enhancement in education. Teachers, too, have very narrow thinking patterns, and they adhere to Jame Beraganeema \u2013 just focus on the minimum duty, responsibility, and accountability. The majority of them are making the minimum effort than maximising their inputs in teaching and guiding. A good number of them do not have language competency and limit their knowledge to the domestic level. No sufficient research and development involvement. They use short cuts for their promotions. No minimum ethical considerations in their role at the university. They use earned funds for the further learning process. A good number of them stay overseas without paying back the funds they used. Even though the university is losing the time, money, and energy spent for further education and training of academic staff. Ultimately, they are like parrots and read notes in the classroom rather than continuing discussions and analysing the facts and figures. No diachronic and synchronic analysis at all. Finally, they do not give any synthesis on the subject matter they focused on. When these situations exist in the university, some of them are aligned with party politics. The trade union \u2013 FUTA \u2013 is not an independent movement. At present many sister associations have been highjacked by JVP supporters. As a norm, university teachers should not do politics. Now, they are directly involved. One Dean says on his FB page, not to mess up with his professional life and political life. How can he give such statements? How does he involve in politics being a position in the university? Another former Dean is the chairman of National People\u2019s Power (NPP) and uses other departments\u2019 names and credentials to do politics in JVP. He misused earned funds of the university while he was serving as the Dean. He could not manage at least his family and his wife ended up committing suicide. As a former monk, he knows Buddhism and applies it instead to socialism. With all these bad sectors, he is given a national position in NPP. Similarly, the Gampaha District Chairman of NPP is also a corrupted person and had to repay stolen money to the university. We all know that other university teachers, too, are having similar bad sectors and now surviving in major political parties. Being in a professional field, neglecting the prime role, and engaging in another role is a real disaster. If they really digested the actual role, they do not need to engage in party politics. While these things are happening, there are ideal characters like Dr. Harini Amarasooriya, who cleared her professional life and involved in a political role by resigning from her university role. As a member of the upper hierarchy social class and a family, she was selected to serve lumpen and suppressed social classes in the country. Except for her, all others who involve in party politics are unethical and biased toward the image of a university teacher. This factor is historically evolved, and the links go to the 80s when Prof. Rathnakara and Prof. Stanley Kalpage supported the UNP. Some who are involved in top-level positions under any government are politicised, and they do not act as independent leaders.",
    "When analysing the time spent, the intellectuals in Sri Lankan universities could produce responsible graduands who are committed to the service and national development if they made somewhat high effort than this. The best example is many of these intellectuals failed to produce graduands who can think and act beyond government service. They failed to produce multi-task graduands who can use the available resources to develop their own livelihood at least. Today, those struggling at many destinations do not have a liberal thinking pattern and global view about their lifestyles. It is not transferred from their teachers because the majority of these teachers are doing their further studies and training at local universities. All these teachers who came out to support the present struggle have been captured by the JVPers. They marched with JVP banners and shouted JVP slogans. At least they failed to develop practical solutions to the current crisis in the country. It shows the pathetic condition of university teachers who join in the struggle. As highlighted above, many SLAS officers are graduands from these universities, and many of them are not having optimism. Today, all state universities are having a big challenge with global universities. If they want to upgrade state universities, they need to adhere to global standards. It is not the duty of politicians. The teachers are responsible for such targets. As we are well aware, the country is having a medical mafia in every health sector. It is not limited to the state medical system, it is visible in the private sector too. Prof. Ranil Jayawardena is one of the best examples of this medical mafia. As a university teacher, he has given a bad and unethical practices to future medical professionals. Therefore, if the university teachers are doing their prime role, there will be a real positive change in the country.",
    "Today, the thinking pattern of leaders has been changed and captured by religious personalities and magicians. The best example is astrologers\u2019 role in the present society. Former president and ex-prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is the leader who fully adhered to these magical practices. President Gotabaya, too surrendered by Gnana Akka, who lived in Anuradhapura. People elected him as the president to change such disenchantments introduced by his elder brother. What are the reasons behind and who takes them to this enchantment situation? This is a pathetic condition that society has moved to backwardness. All these magical practices took place in covert culture. Those who followed these practices are uneducated and lack confidence in their life event. The monks who are involved in magical practices are making these social and cultural barriers. The unlimited expectations of the people enlarged this platform in society.\u00a0 The dependency syndrome of government officers and the public is another catastrophic condition in the country. The majority of them depend on government subsidies and other programmes, and it is a feature evolved from the pre-independent era. Free education, free health, subsidsed fertilisers, and other social benefits implemented in the country never give any targets for the beneficiaries. If someone enjoys free education, they should use it up to the maximum level, and she or he should make a determination not to use it for the next generation. Unless there is no limit, and the endless burden is making unnecessary obligations to the government. Any welfare facility should be given to suppressed groups in society, not to the upper classes. Today, all upper classes are enjoying maximum benefits while suppressed classes do not have opportunities to uplift their livelihood. Wealthy people occupied all popular National Schools. Ultimately, this practice is prolonged by generations. They simply adapted to the Jame Beraganeeme thinking pattern rather than they are taking the role of responsibilities. This stance is developed a pessimistic ideology among the various segments and communities in the country. When analysing the existing situation of dependency syndrome, it is not an easy thing to change. Perhaps it may take a longer period, but without inculcating positive values, attitudes, and norms by the responsible segments in the society, it is difficult to change the situation.",
