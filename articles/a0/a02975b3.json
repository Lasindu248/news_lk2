    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka must begin rebuilding its agriculture sector immediately to forestall looming food shortages and to retain the international market for export crops, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cWe are losing the international market for our export crops.\u00a0 Action must be taken to prevent this. [Inorganic] fertilizers are needed to boost local agriculture.\u00a0 It costs 600 million US dollars a year to import fertilizer for paddy, vegetables, fruits, other major crops as well as our tea, rubber, coconut and export crops.",
    "\u201cSince manure has to be applied from time to time from the beginning to the end of a harvest, it is essential that fertilizer is exported without any shortages. We must ensure that no money or effort will be wasted,\u201d Wickremesinghe said in a statement made to parliament on Monday (07).",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s agriculture sector has taken a catastrophic hit from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s ill-conceived overnight shift to organic farming. Compounded by the country\u2019s worsening forex crisis, Sri Lanka is now looking at a possible food shortage around October, as warned by several government officials including Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.",
    "\u201cOur harvest has declined in the past several months. We have to face this situation at and we have to work hard from this point onwards to ensure the next harvest is a success. That harvest, however, will be available by the end of February 2023,\u201d said Wickremesinghe.",
    "\u201cIn terms of rice, our country\u2019s annual rice requirement is 2.5 million metric tons.\u00a0 But we have only 1.6 million metric tons of rice in stock.\u00a0 This is not limited to paddy but applies to many other crops. In a few months we will have to face serious difficulties and shortages in terms of our diets. We need to import food items to meet our daily requirements. It costs about 150 million dollars a month,\u201d he said.",
    "Meanwhile, the cabinet of ministers on Monday (06) approved a proposal to provide 150,000 MT of urea, 45,000 MT of MOP and 36,000 MT of TSP fertilizer for farmers for the next Maha cultivation season through the Ceylon Fertilizer Company and the Colombo Commercial Fertilizer company.",
