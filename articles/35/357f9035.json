    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday (07) called for unity and bipartisanship to introduce lasting, meaningful reforms including in the state sector and steer the country through its worst economic crisis since Independence.",
    "Addressing parliament Monday morning, Wickremesinghe said a concerted effort was needed to rebuild the country and called for changes to the state sector.",
    "\u201cI hope you all understand the situation we and our country face. We need to find new ways as an alternative to the traditional ways if we are to elevate the country from this position. We must set aside our traditional political ideologies for a short period of time and make a concerted effort to rebuild the country. Every citizen must play a role in this. We all have a part to play for the country,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe said the government was no longer able to finance the losses of any state-owned enterprise (SOE).",
    "\u201cMany government agencies do not have proper financial management. Therefore, new methods need to be introduced. The Road Development Authority (RDA) is an example. Though they had the funds, they failed to manage those funds in accordance with Treasury regulations. In the current situation in our country, the government is unable to provide funds to cover the losses of any state-owned enterprises. That debt burden can no longer be borne by the state or state-owned banks,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Wickremesinghe said, are based on the country\u2019s future economic plan. The year 2023 will see the island nation face more challenges, he said.",
    "\u201cWe need to achieve economic stability by the end of this year. Then by 2024 we will have the opportunity to create economic stimulus through financial stimulus.\u00a0 By 2025, our goal is to balance our budgets or create a primary surplus.\u00a0 This economic program must continue to move towards this long-term goal.\u00a0 Even if the individuals, groups and parties in power change, it is imperative that we achieve our national goals and maintain the highest level of efficiency in the country,\u201d he said.",
    "The government\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a new economy for Sri Lanka,\u00a0 said Wickremesinghe. The goal is to transform Sri Lanka into a developed country by 2048, the centenary of Independence, he said.",
    "\u201cOur country is not working like a well-oiled machine, we are not sure what we should we do first. This system needs to be overhauled. That is what we are doing now: resetting the system,\u201d he added.",
    "The government will present an interim budget as a first step in this effort, the PM said.",
    "Sri Lanka to present interim budget cutting cutting capex: PM",
    "\u201cWe can save the country if we make gradual progress.\u00a0 There is a dangerous situation that goes beyond being a personal issue or a party issue. Let us understand the dangers and seriousness of this. In such a situation, there is no point in looking at the past. For a while let us forget the past.\u00a0 In trying to renew the country, we must think only of the future,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe has been accused by opposition parties and Sri Lanka\u2019s protesting youths of serving the interests of the Rajapaksa family, whose ouster from national politics the public has been agitating for over two months.",
    "\u201cEconomic reforms alone are not enough to rebuild a country.\u00a0 At the same time, socio-political and public service reforms are needed,\u201d he said.",
    "The PM said parliamentarians must come together to find lasting solutions rather than BandAids.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s set aside all differences and think anew for the country. Let\u2019s embark on a new journey. We will initiate the necessary constitutional reforms. Let\u2019s think differently. We can all start to change the system by thinking differently and acting differently,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe called for sweeping reforms in the public service and also to end corruption.",
    "\u201cPublic service must be viewed from a different angle. Efficiency and productivity have fallen to a very low level due to the provision of unlimited employment in the public service. Some government employees have no obligation to their duties.\u00a0 Therefore, the public sector needs to be completely restructured and reformed.\u00a0 Our mission is to create a public service that will enable a citizen to receive immediate and efficient services throughout their lives without any hassle.",
    "\u201cIn 2019, a national policy to combat bribery and corruption was developed. We will take steps to hand over the draft policy to all party leaders in parliament. Get their feedback too. Countries such as Sweden, which have successfully implemented the anti-corruption and anti-corruption mechanism, are following the example of the Hong Kong government and making the necessary structural changes. If any amendments are to be made to the present draft, necessary amendments will be made in consultation with all parties\u2019 lawyers and experts and this National Policy will be implemented,\u201d he said.",
    "Wickremesinghe extended an open invitation to all parties represented in parliament to support his government\u2019s economic, socio-political and public service reforms in rebuilding the country.",
    "\u201cLet us build the country first.\u00a0 Let us protect our country from this crisis. Give your support to these efforts. After returning to normalcy in the country within the specified time frame, you may return to your traditional political activities. Implement traditional party political agendas.",
    "\u201cThe pessimist sees difficulty in every situation; the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty,\u201d he added, quoting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.",
    "\u201cWe take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way. We will use these opportunities to build the country with confidence. We will all take full responsibility to bring the country back to normalcy,\u201d he said. (Colombo/May07/2022)"
