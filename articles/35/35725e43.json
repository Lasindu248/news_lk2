  "body_lines": [
    "COLOMBO (News 1st); A decision may be taken to grant uninterrupted electricity supply, if the provision of electricity to cans and barrels cease and if hydropower is properly managed, says the Minister of Energy, Kanchana Wijesekara.",
    "Speaking at the media briefing today (21), the Minister said that a policy decision will also have to be taken to grant more stocks of crude oil and diesel to power plants in order to generate power, to enable uninterrupted supply of electricity.",
    "Accordingly, the Minister stated that the CEB Chairman has informed in writing with regard to the fuel requirements, while students and other respective parties too have requested for no power cuts to be implemented during the time which G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination is being held.",
    "It is easier to provide diesel to the CEB rather than to cans and barrels, and therefore a decision can be taken to completely stop provision of diesel for generators, the Minister said.",
    "Meanwhile, a ship carrying Diesel is also scheduled to arrive in the country on Monday (23), which will also allow authorities to reach this decision, he added.",
