  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka opposition legislator Patali Champika Ranawaka told parliament on Tuesday (08) that he will function as a independent opposition MP leaving the main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) alliance.",
    "Announcing his decision, Ranawaka called for an all-party, interim government. Change should come from within parliament as well as from the public, he said.",
    "The MP, who analysts say have harboured presidential ambitions, said that he had an understanding with opposition and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa.",
    "\u201cI informed [Premadasa] of my decision a few days ago. We joined the SJB alliance in March 2020 according to an MOU. This separation is per that same MOU. I have always worked with my conscience.",
    "\u201cMore than ever, both the government and the opposition have to act responsibly in parliament. The objective in my becoming independent was to facilitate that.",
    "The MP also denied speculation that he was going to join the government.",
    "\u201cSome media and social media have claimed that I did this to get a ministry in the government. There is no truth whatever to those interpretations. I have no wish to hold any portfolio in this government. (Colombo/Jun08/2022)a"
