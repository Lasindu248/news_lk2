    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka opposition leader Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday (04) blamed Finance Minister Ali Sabry for his role as then Justice Minister in passing the 20th amendment in 2020 which controversially restored a number of executive powers of the president, which Premadasa claimed contributed to the economic and political crises Sri Lanka is now facing.",
    "\u201cThe 20th amendment that you brought created a one-man show establishing a dictatorship., Science was ignored for myth and farmers, fishermen, labourers, small and medium enterprises, lower, middle and upper classes, urban dwellers, self employed, and daily wage earners were all ruinedas a result,\u201d Premadasa said speaking in parliament.",
    "The opposition leader spoke after a speech by Sabry in which the latter acknowledged \u201cmistakes\u201d made by the government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, particularly with regard to ill-advised tax cuts, not engaging the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sooner and not restructuring debt.",
    "Premadasa said Sabry\u2019s belated mea culpa was pointless, and that the government must at least now call it a day.",
    "\u201cThose responsible for this must definitely go home. The president, the prime minister and the government must go home,\u201d he said.",
    "Sri Lanka is going through the worst economic crisis in the country\u2019s history, leading to unprecedented protests islandwide demanding the resignation of the government.",
    "\u201cPlease, as demanded by the people of this country, resign and give them the opportunity to elect a new government,\u201d said Premadasa. (Colombo/May04/2022)"
