    "COLOMBO (News 1st);\u00a0SriLankan Airlines states that it has issued four requests for proposals (RFPs) to lease up to 21 aircraft to support its long-term business strategy.",
    "Accordingly, this includes two RFPs covering existing fleet types (320 and 330 family aircraft) and two parallel RFPs to compare with alternative aircraft types. Roughly 60% of the planned aircraft will be for fleet replacement, and the remainder will be to support the airline\u2019s expansion strategy and meet the growing demand for air travel between Sri Lanka and the world.",
    "Prior to the pandemic, in 2019, SriLankan had an all-Airbus fleet of 27 wide and narrow-bodied aircraft to service its short and long-haul operations. During Covid, there were no replacements for three aircraft that left the fleet. The airline currently has 24 aircraft to operate to 40 destinations in 25 countries, the statement further reads.",
    "SriLankan is planning for measured growth in the next three years through frequency increases and the addition of new destinations as international travel is in a trajectory of recovery from the pandemic. The business plan of the airline necessitates a 35-aircraft-strong fleet by 2025.",
    "Additionally, it is critical to lease replacement aircraft when existing aircraft leases expire to sustain operations.\u00a0 Considering these factors, SriLankan plans to lease up to 21 aircraft from the forthcoming RFP process.",
