    "Users of Commercial Bank of Ceylon\u2019s popular Q+ Payment App can now settle the outstanding due on credit cards issued by other banks via the in-app Bill Payments option, in addition to settling dues on credit cards issued by Commercial Bank.This significant enhancement in functionality makes it possible for credit card holders to settle their monthly statement balances from anywhere and at anytime and have their credit card accounts updated in real time, the Bank said.",
    "Commenting on this latest development, the Chief Manager of Commercial Bank\u2019s Card Centre Mr Nishantha De Silva said: \u201cWe are constantly looking at ways to maximise the versatility and convenience offered by technology-based products and services. As a result, the Q+ Payment App periodically receives upgrades that enhance its value to users. The facility to settle dues on credit cards of other banks is one example.\u201dCustomers can enjoy this facility in three simple steps via their smart phones after downloading the Q+ Payment App from the App Store or Google Play Store, signing up by filling in the required details such as User ID and e-mail and creating a Q+ Payment App account. Credit card bills can be settled by linking Debit or Prepaid Cards to the App, clicking on the \u2018Bill Payment\u2019 menu on the App, and selecting the \u2018Cards\u2019 tab.",
    "Q+ Payment App users can also save their recurring credit card bill payments under the \u2018Favourites\u2019 tab to avoid re-entering billing account numbers.
