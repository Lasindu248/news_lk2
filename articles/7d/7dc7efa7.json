    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s forex market opened with bids at 230 to the US dollar but no offers after the central bank said overnight it was allowing greater exchange rate flexibility after running out of reserves.",
    "The central bank had earlier decreed a 200 to the US dollar rate for the exchange rate and was giving reserves for imports to defend the rate, forcing it to sterilize the interventions with new money at the policy rate.",
    "Central Bank Governor Nivard Cabraal said the change in stance was needed given the changing global scenario.",
    "\u201cWe have given a guidance. It is a float,\u201d Cabraal said. \u201cWe stand ready to take additional policy measures.\u201d",
    "However the current policy measures were sufficient. Cabraal had called for tighter fiscal policy in the form of higher taxes and fuel price hikes to contain domestic credit.",
    "The central bank gave guidance overnight at 230 saying it was \u201cof the view that forex transactions would take place at levels which are not more than Rs. 230 per US dollar.\u201d",
    "As market opened Tuesday there were bids at 230 to the US dollar but there were no offers from nervous dealers.",
    "Former central bank Governor W A Wijewardena welcome the move saying a float the correct step to unify parallel exchange rate but said monetary policy should be tightened to stop the rupee from falling too low.",
    "\u201cIn principle allowing the exchange rate to move is the right move,\u201d Wijewardene said."
