    "While stating that Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves would dry up further after the Sinhala New Year, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said what Sri Lanka needs today is not a change of government but a change of systems including vast economic reforms to avoid a revolution.",
    "Speaking during an interview over social media,Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka's foreign reserves would dry up in a few days after the New Year. \u201cOur foreign reserves will dry up in a few days\u2019 time after the New Year. The economy could be run with the use of Indian credit lines and other assistance only till the first or second week in May. Inflation will continue to rise until August. Inflation is something which is like fever which goes up to maximum before it goes down. Private companies may have to shut down by August this year. Therefore what we need is a plan to revive the economy. We have to revive the economy at least within the next two years. What I propose is new legislation for Parliament to take over the finances. I am preparing a set of reforms for this purpose,\u201d Wickremeisnghe said.",
    "\u201cOne should understand the situation which prevails today. People who have been led by the youth want a new beginning and a complete change of the systems. Parliament at the moment is focusing on a change of government. Peaceful protests that are going on at the moment will turn into a revolution if we turn a deaf ear to people\u2019s demands,\u201d he added. (Yohan Perera)"
