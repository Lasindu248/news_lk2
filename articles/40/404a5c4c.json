  "title": "A Brief Response to the Current National Crisis \u2013 A Way Forward",
  "body_lines": [
    "Sri Lanka is at a crossroad, facing current multiple crises, as well as the present impasse of an unwanted Executive with all powers and an inadequate Legislature with little powers. The call of citizens, united in their diversity, is for real change. This requires clear priorities and a framework for a sustainable development plan for Sri Lanka which assigns responsibility to its Executive, Legislature and Public Service to implement that plan. This analysis tries to provide a structured way for the country to do so, based on 3 national priorities.",
    "A. National Priorities \u2013 1. Improving the Well-Being of All Citizens, 2. Safeguarding the Environment and 3. Rebuilding Key Institutions",
    "This prioritisation assumes the basic premise that nations strive to improve the well-being of all citizens and safeguard their environment, which requires sustainable development with social justice, that minimises inequalities and poverty.",
    "\u2022 Well-being\u201d \u2013 material, intellectual and emotional quality of life",
    "\u2022 \u201cSustainable Development\u201d \u2013progress in well-being lasting for future generations",
    "\u2022 \u201cSocial Justice\u201d \u2013 impartiality in access and opportunities for all, regardless of race, religion, income, social status, gender, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or any other differentiating factor",
    "The importance of citizens\u2019 rights in relation to the first 2 priorities, human well-being and safeguarding Sri Lanka\u2019s environment, must be recognised in our Constitution. Equally important, is rebuilding Sri Lanka\u2019s key institutions for implementation of policies and laws for sustainable development with social justice to realise the first 2 priorities.",
    "1. Improving the Well-Being of All Citizens \u2013 Material, Intellectual and Emotional",
    "What\u2019s Wrong? \u2013 Successive governments lost sight of this underlying goal. Instead, national development plans have targeted the means to the goal (economic growth, investment, exports), sometimes at a cost to the goal itself.",
    "1.1 Foreign exchange, foreign debt, inflation, fiscal and economic crisis \u2013Monetary and Fiscal mismanagement created these crises. Prepare a sustainable plan to raise confidence, restructure debt, obtain immediate bridge financing for a social safety net and essential imports of food, medicines, fuel, gas, intermediate goods to regenerate the economy and foreign earnings.",
    "1.2 Constitutional crisis \u2013 Successive governments have stalled the process of constitutional reform and abolition of an over-powerful executive presidency. The GoGotaGo Movement is not merely a cry for a President to resign, but also for constitutional reform with effective checks and balances. Establish a secular new constitution with these national priorities at its core that overcomes existing weaknesses.",
    "1.3 Corruption and law and order crisis\u2013In recent years the country has experienced crony capitalism, blatant corruption at the highest levels and plunder of Sri Lanka\u2019s assets, while the application of the law was seen as discriminatory, partisan and unequal. The recent independent stand of the Bar Association questioning state action reflects this. Restore confidence of citizenry in the integrity of the executive, legislature, police and justice systems, by strengthening relevant laws and strict implementation of the same, while ensuring independent, equal application of the law to all citizens.",
    "1.4 COVID-related health, welfare and economic crisis \u2013 Sri Lanka needed, but did not have, an emergency plan, for vaccination, food distribution, phased people movement, transport and economic activities, in place during the pandemic. Review handling of Covid related issues, positives and negatives, and prepare an effective plan for any similar crisis.",
    "1.5 Raise public awareness on the constitution, the economy, the law, citizens\u2019 rights, particularly minority rights, and the need for reform.",
    "1.6 Right to Representation \u2013 Electoral Reforms for meaningful representation that reflects Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity at national, provincial and local government levels.",
    "1.7 Right to Justice \u2013 Judicial Reforms through a systematic review process of existing laws and procedures which currently hamper delivery of justice.",
    "1.8 Right to social and cultural freedom of expression and personal safety \u2013 Police and Legal Reforms to ensure freedom of expression and zero tolerance of discrimination on any differentiating factor. Build official tri-lingual capacity to ensure access to language rights and official communication in all 3 languages.",
    "1.9 Right to Health \u2013 Policy and regulatory reforms to ensure cost-effective state and private, preventive and curative health service delivery to citizens.",
    "1.10 Right to Nutrition \u2013 Policy consistency across agriculture and trade, to ensure food security and to increase value addition in agro-processing and agricultural exports.",
    "1.11 Right to Social Safety Net \u2013 Welfare and social security reforms and policy consistency, with relevant and timely information for decision-making, to ensure adequate safety nets for all vulnerable citizens.",
    "1.12 Right to Housing \u2013 Policy reforms to ensure access to housing markets across all socio-economic strata.",
    "1.13 Right to Education \u2013Education Reforms in curricula, teacher training, technology and infrastructure to suit today\u2019s world. Regulate state and private institutions to ensure quality service delivery to citizens.",
    "1.14 Right to Gainful Employment \u2013 Labour Market and related Legal Reforms to recognise and regulate new forms of atypical employment; establish liveable minimum wages policy; establish decent working conditions and allow employers more hiring flexibility, while protecting worker rights, thereby reversing people drain.",
    "1.15 Right to a sustainable natural environment \u2013 Legal and related Reforms and action plans to reverse environmental destruction through a review process of existing laws, penalties and procedures.",
    "1.16 Right to information \u2013 Address inadequate budgets, supply-side constraints and need for capacity building in key data agencies to ensure transparent methodology and access to public data.",
    "1.17 Right of access to essential utilities and government services \u2013 National Administrative System Reform to eliminate multiple levels of authorisation for simple requirements, with a clear demarcation of what services are to be delivered at national, provincial and local government level, to ensure effective and efficient administration.",
    "1.18 Right to stability of financial system and responsible fiscal management \u2013 Reform Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to ensure independence. Improve fiscal management and accountability at General Treasury.",
    "1.19 Right to conduct business in an ethical, transparent, level playing field \u2013 Institutional and Legal Reforms to rationalise and simplify business regulation and approvals, with zero tolerance of bribery and corruption.",
    "1.20 Right to National Security \u2013 Clarify role of Armed Forces. Foreign Policy Reform to include rationale for geopolitical relationships that ensures safety against physical, social or economic international threats.",
    "What\u2019s Wrong? Without consistent plans, guidelines and adequate checks and balances to safeguard our biodiversity, ad-hoc \u201cdevelopment\u201d has taken a severe toll on our environment, thereby jeopardising the future.",
    "2.1 Maritime environmental crisis \u2013 Review and gather information on the progress or lack of progress on the recent case and establish processes to prevent other such occurrences in the future.",
    "2.2 Plastic and toxic chemical pollution of land and waterbodies \u2013 Immediate ban on plastic with strict penalties for violations.",

    "o encroachment, invasive plant sand water plants, loss of animal and bird life in the above natural habitats",
    "o detrimental landfills, plastic, fuel and other pollution within the above habitats",
    "3. Rebuilding Key Institutions to Ensure Independence, Professionalism and Accountability.",
    "What\u2019s Wrong? \u2013 A Complete breakdown of independence, professionalism, accountability, channel-of-command and decision-making processes in key institutions critically hinders national systems from delivering services to achieve priorities 1 and 2. Currently, overlapping functions in over 30,000 entities functioning under 1,300 government institutions with 1.5 million employees, is both inefficient and costly.",
    "3.1 Decision-making \u2013 Select Professionals with acumen to key positions, with guidelines for recruitment based on meritocracy",
    "3.2 Public Sector Contraction and Reforms \u2013 Re-introduce responsibility, delegation of authority, co-ordination, channel-of-command and accountability. Cull ineffective institutions and posts.",

    "2. Select professionals with knowledge, experience and acumen to key Public Service positions.",
    "3. Define broad areas of responsibility and policy based on the Universal Rights identified from 1.1-1.20 above and taken from items 3.4-3.25 above.",

    "5. Assign each Government institution to the relevant Ministry identified at 4 above.",
    "6. Review all Government institutions with a view to eradicating duplication of responsibility by retaining/combining/ closing institutions, as necessary.",
    "8. Appoint experienced and capable professionals, giving due recognition to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS), as Secretaries to all Ministries.

Hold Secretaries responsible for smooth functioning of their ministries and all government institutions under their respective ministries. Monitor performance and implement stiff penalties and fines under the law for any government official found guilty of bribery or corruption.",

    "13. Identify specific Universal Rights of citizens to be enshrined in a new Constitution using 1.1 to 1.20 above.",
    "14. Prepare a separate code of ethics and guidelines or incorporate checks and balances into the new Constitution, to address the issues raised in 3.1-3.3 above.",
    "15. Prepare a new Constitution and limit the size of the Cabinet of Ministers, based on 3.4-3.5 above.",
