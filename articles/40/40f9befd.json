    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s agriculture minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage, who has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism over the government\u2019s failed green agriculture policy, has vowed that the present administration will not be brought down.",
    "Speaking at an event, Aluthgamage acknowledged the difficulties faced by the public as a result of Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis.",
    "\u201cWe understand this difficulty. We understand very well the strain on the people. As a sensitive government, we take ownership of that responsibility.",
    "Sri Lanka is currently going through one of the worst economic crises in the country\u2019s history, with people queuing up for essentials including fuel, cooking gas and milk powder as the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves continue to plummet. The ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)\u2019s popularity is at an all-time low, and daily power outages and skyrocketing cost of living have forced many people to organise their own protests independent of opposition parties.",
    "The main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) led by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa held a major protest march against the government\u2019s handling of the crisis on March 15 with thousands of party supporters shouting slogans against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.",
    "However, Minister Alutghamage does not see the opposition protests as a threat to the SLPP-leg government.",
    "\u201cThey think the government will fall if three or four people in parliament make some statement or if Sajith Premadasa brings a crowd to Galle Face.",
    "\u201cFriends, we tell them, even if they stand on their head and say it, we guarantee to the people that this government cannot be brought down,\u201d he said. (Colombo/Mar21/2022)"
