    "The Inter Provincial Private Bus Owners' Association (IPPBOA) said they have decided to hold operating bus service, if the bus fare revision is made focusing only on considering the diesel price hike.",
    "1IPPBOA Presidet Sarath Vijitha Kumara told the Daily Mirror that it is reported that the bus fare need to be increased by 15%, and it is not sufficient for long distance passenger transport services. He claimed that the prices of tyres and tubes as well as lubricants and services rose by 35%.",
    "As a result, the bus fare revision should be taken into account considering not only the price of diesel but also the other criteria.",
    "Somehow, if the bus fare revision is announced only considering the fuel prices, the association will be compelled to stop operating inter-provincial and long distance services with immediate effect, Vijitha Kumara added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
