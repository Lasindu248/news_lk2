    "With the increase of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) fuel prices from early this morning, the All-Island Three-Wheeler Drivers' Union (AITWDU) lamented that there will be an increase in the three-wheeler fare.",
    "AITWDU President Lalith Dharmasekera told the Daily Mirror that they did not increase the three-wheeler fare during the past two instances where fuel prices had gone up.",
    "At that time, we requested the three-wheeler operators to determine the fare after discussing with the passenger. Now it has come to a difficult situation to have that negotiation.",
    "Therefore, we are hoping to increase the fare of the first km to Rs.100 and the second km to Rs.80 with the view to sustain the three-wheeler industry. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
