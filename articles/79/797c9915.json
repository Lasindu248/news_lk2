    "Sri Lanka\u2019s prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told Sky News that \u201cthe last administration is to blame\u201d for the country\u2019s current crisis.",
    "Protesters have clashed with police in Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, Colombo, as people demanded the resignation of the president and new prime minister.",
    "Demonstrations in the capital have been ongoing for the last two months as the public blames the country\u2019s leadership for corruption and mishandling the economy.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the last administration \u201cis to blame\u201d for the current situation in his country as they \u201cran down the economy\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe have come to a point where we are bankrupt - which has never happened to Sri Lanka before,\u201d he said in an interview with Sky News following his controversial appointment last week.",
    "On whether the president should resign, the veteran politician said it\u2019s a \u201ccontroversy\u201d as the country is of split opinion.",
    "He added: \u201cI suggested that after Sri Lanka passes the 21st amendment, the country should restore the original 19th amendment strengthening parliament - strengthening the powers of the prime minister.",
    "\u201cThen, all party leaders and the president should have a discussion and come to some arrangement on the future.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, the recent unrest across the country has been sparked amid the country\u2019s worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948, which has been blamed on a combination of COVID, rising oil prices and populist tax cuts by the president and his brother, until recently the prime minister.",
    "\u201cI can understand the anguish of the protesters - the young and the old,\u201d Mr Wickremesinghe said.",
    "\u201cThe young who see their future being taken away, and the old, who are suffering, the middle class, who see their lifestyle collapsing\u2026 farmers without fertiliser.",
    "\u201cThere are many demonstrations outside police stations, petrol stations and other places. And it shows the anger, the despair, and the hopelessness that the people feel.\u201d",
    "He said that people, at the moment, \u201ccan\u2019t bear the burden any longer\u201d.",
    "Police have now arrested more than 800 people nationwide who are accused of ransacking property, looting and setting fire to MPs\u2019 houses on 9 May.",
    "But human rights lawyers say in some cases police are jailing people who were out on the streets watching what was happening, rather than actively taking part in violence.",
    "The prime minister went on to say that the country faces a possibility of a food crisis due to the lack of fertiliser.",
    "Sri Lanka is near bankruptcy after announcing it had suspended up to $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) in foreign loans due to be repaid this year because of a foreign currency crisis.",
    "It has led to limited imports with no gas in petrol stations. Other fuel, cooking gas, medicine and foods are in short supply forcing people to stay in long lines to buy the limited stocks.",
    "\u201cWe are feeling the rise in the price of fuel - and we know it will go higher,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOur main concern also is that we have not had fertiliser for cultivation, and this coming season, the rice cultivation season will not have the full production.",
    "\u201cTherefore from about August onwards, there is a possibility of a food crisis in Sri Lanka. That\u2019s about the time when the global food crisis will also take place, and we will see how we will survive until about March next year.\u201d"
