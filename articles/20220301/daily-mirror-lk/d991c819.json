Local environmental organizations believe that the Government as per Paragraph 3(1) of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act No 23 of 1979 released the Mahaoya and Padiyatalawa Divisional Secretariats by Gazette no 1130/13 dated 04.05.2000 and Rideemaliyadda Divisional Secretariat in Ampara district by Gazette no 1130/41 dated 02.09.2010 from the control of the SMWFC and declared the areas as Mahaweli territories to remove the hindrances to the project. Information regarding the land takeover by the Mahaweli Authority of these lands is in report no L/RO/RI/03/13 dated 25.06.2013 and was released by the Director General of Mahaweli authority to the Chairman of Central Environmental Authority.",

    "Booker Tate was the first company to implement the Bibile Sugar Development Project in 2006. Booker Tate also invested to initiate the Pelwatte Sugar Company in Buttala. This project received immense public opposition. At the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Investment Promotion and headed by the then President on March 3, 2006, the President advised the Director General of\u00a0 SMWFC to present a report after conducting a field visit on the proposed land for the project. M. G. Sarath Fernando who was the then Director General of SMWFC visiting the project area on March 16 and 17, 2006 prepared a report. Additional secretary (lands), provincial lands commissioner, deputy conservator of forest of Uva and Central provinces and Surveyor General, district forest officer of Badulla and forest rangers of the area took part in this visit. They presented their recommendations regarding the project. Accordingly, those lands contain main water catchment areas of Senanayaka Samudraya in Ampara and long-term leasing of the lands can severely impact the Samudraya. Some lands identified by the company as barren lands were part of the Nilgala Forest and they could not be released at all, they added. The report made mention of the possibility of a human-elephant conflict occurring in the future if the project goes ahead because the designated land borders the buffer zone of the SMWFC and it was the water catchment area of Senanayake Samudraya in Ampara, the recommendations of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and the Irrigation Department (ID) should be sought. On the instructions of the then Director of Archaeology and the Uva province Assistant Director of Archaeology, an archaeological exploration was conducted in the proposed land for the sugar factory in Akiriyan paddy land in Dehigama, headed by Archaeological Research Assistant of Diyatalawa regional office on October 9,10 and 11 2007 with the assistance of Research Assistants of Diyatalawa archaeology office Parakrama Bandara and Sameera Ariyathilaka. According to their report, this area was declared as a part of Nilgala Reserve under the Forest Department (FD). Accordingly, there are many caves with Kataram carving and stone stairs and an old building remains in Medagoda area in the proposed land. The report mentions that there were remains of an old stupa and features of an irrigation industry 400 metres to the north-west of the building. There are many tombs 100 metres to the north-east of the tank and several other archaeologically valuable ruins are scattered everywhere. The proposed land contains many places of archaeological value. As the area was close to Maduru Oya many other archaeological places and pre-historic tools could be discovered, the report said.",

    "Gazelle Ventures Pvt Ltd has agreed to invest in the Sugar Development Project. The company has agreed to invest 152.25 million US$. Its project report reveals that the company expects to produce 14% of the sugar requirement of the country; which is 80,000 MT, 36,000 MT of Molasses, 40,000 MT of animal feed, 12,000 MT of organic fertilizer and 20 mw of eco friendly renewable energy. 1000 direct employment opportunities and 25000 indirect employment opportunities are expected. Gazelle Ventures will own 88% of the shares of Bibile Sugar Factory which implements the project and IMS Holdings will own 1%. Farmers cultivating sugar cane through agreements will have 1% and the Mahaweli Authority another 1% of the total shares. The company has agreed to pay a facility fee of 25 cents for each kilo of sugar produced in the factory in addition to the lease paid for the 149 hectares taken over from Mahaweli authority to build the factory. This information is confirmed by the letter sent by Mahaweli Authority Director General Gamini Rajakaruna to the Central Environmental Authority Chairman.",
    "Director of Parisara Yukthi Kendraya Hemantha Withanage, who is a renowned environmental scientist in the country, said that while Gazelle Ventures agreed to all the conditions, it requested from the Mahaweli authority 37500 acres to cultivate sugar cane. \u201cThey are indirectly asking to distribute the lands- which were under the Forest Department and were cultivated by people and later acquired by the Mahaweli Authority- among people who were willing to cultivate sugar cane. They have requested the authority for 7500 more acres for a Gliricidia cultivation. The company asked for 372 acres from Dehigama area in Rideemaliyadda to build the factory and 130 acres for a seed bed. The Mahaweli authority has taken over the lands under the Forest Department and rich lands cultivated by innocent people from Mahaoya, Padiyatalawa, and Rideemaliyadda are to be given to the company for something less as 1% of the shares. The Singaporean company receives 88% of the total profit. The company also asked for 1.5 million cubic metres of water for 25 cents a litre from Maduru Oya for the factory and the seed bed during the period from October to March every year. In addition they said they would obtain 1.5 million cubic metres of water from tube wells. These requirements are of serious nature. With the ongoing climate changes we cannot expect continuous rains with regard to the monsoons. If this amount of water is taken from Maduru Oya, many farmers will be affected directly. If underground water is taken as required by the company the underground water level of the area would reduce causing environmental damage,\u201d Withanage added.",

In addition many forest lands under the forest department were taken over by the Mahaweli authority. Director of the Species Conservation Centre Pubudu Weerarathne said many of the acquired lands of the Forest Department were in the buffer zones in Galoya and Maduruoya national parks and these areas were occupied by elephants and contained elephant corridors. \u201cThe factory is proposed to be built blocking an elephant corridor. This will create human elephant conflicts which never existed. For a project of this sort an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) should be conducted taking the whole thing into consideration, but they have done so only with regard to 149 hectares of land on which the factory was to be built ignoring the rest of the area. This was done on purpose and is illegal.\u201d Weerarathne added.",

This project is planned to be carried out illegally. The relevant company has not conducted a proper EIA. The lands have been forcibly acquired. There are many farmers engaged in traditional chena cultivation in the area for decades.
