    "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna MP and COPE Chief Charitha Herath has endorsed what former Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said about forming a national Government collaboratively with all parties.",
    "Taking to his Twitter handle Dr. Herath said that the Government along with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa should step down immediately.",
    "He proposed six steps to manage the way forward, in which the first is for the present Government to step down, secondly to form a national- caretaker type small Government for a short period of six to eight months, and thirdly, to step up the ongoing International Monetary Fund discussion and quickly plan the economic corrections.",
    "Dr. Herath also recommends that an election must be held after eight months, given that economic hardships will be managed to some extent by that time, whilst suggesting passing the 21 Amendment to the Constitution.",
    "On Friday, former Media Minister Alahapperuma sent a hard letter to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa requesting for the Cabinet as well as the Prime Minister to step down and to form an All-Party Government immediately to overcome the political instability."
