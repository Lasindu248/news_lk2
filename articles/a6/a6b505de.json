    "They said the accident took place at the railway crossing at Mampalam Junction in Ariyalai, when a Colombo-Jaffna intercity express train coming slammed against the car.",

    "The deceased have been identified as Viduranga Fernando, 35 and Mohammad Sajam, 31, both from Bingiriya, Kurunegala.",
