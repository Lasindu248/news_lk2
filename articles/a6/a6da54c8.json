He has been personally mentored by Jack Canfield, Les Brown, Brian Tracy, Keith Cunningham, Jay Abraham, Tony Robbins, and many others.

    "Business leaders got an opportunity to learn how to create a culture where not just clients, but everyone from the front line workers to the C-suite executives feel totally cared for and special. \u201cThe frontline employees are the first point of contact with your clients, if you do not treat them well, they can very easily put your customers off. Always look for opportunities to prop people up and not to knock them down,\u201d he said.",

    "\u201cListening intently means, I intend to take what you said and act on it. This does not necessarily mean to be a problem solver but a solution provider. Also, listening intently helps to provide a highly personalized service, specific to each client,\u201d he said are important elements for providing outstanding service. \u201cStart by changing the way you think. Everything we do is based on what we believe and how we feel. Therefore it is important to train our brain to work for us and be comfortable with being uncomfortable, rather than being controlled by automatic thinking,\u201d he said.",
