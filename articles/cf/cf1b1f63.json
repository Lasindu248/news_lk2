I\u2019ve tried to pick out highlights, but as it\u2019s one of the records of this year \u2013 2019 \u2013 (or any other for that matter) it\u2019s tricky. You have to own this.\u201d",
    "= Reflections in Blue (USA):  \u201cTen original tunes that absolutely nail the sound and spirit of Memphis soul. Marr has been compared to Betty Lavette and Tina Turner and with good reason. She delivers vocals with power and soul and has a compelling stage presence. McNamara\u2019s vocals are reminiscent of the likes of Sam & Dave or even Otis Redding. This is quality work that would be every bit as well received, in the late 1950s, as it is today. It is truly timeless.\u201d",
    "= La Hora Del Blues (Spain): \u201cAndrea Marr\u2019s voice gives us the same feeling as artistes, like Betty Lavette, Tina Turner or Sharon Jones, perfectly supported by John McNamara\u2019s work, on vocals and guitar\u2026in short words, GREAT!\u201d",
