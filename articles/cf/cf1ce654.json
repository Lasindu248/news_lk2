    "Former Prime Minister and Leader of the United National Party (UNP), Ranil Wickremesinghe, has called for an immediate debate in Parliament on the IMF report on Sri Lanka.",
    "\u201cAs the Government has agreed to engage the IMF for financial assistance, the Parliament must be briefed on their plan of action,\u201d he was quoted as saying by party\u2019s media unit.",
    "International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday released its Article IV consultation report on Sri Lanka which highlights that the island nation faces \u201csolvency\u201d issues because of risks stemming from unsustainable debt levels that jeopardize the country\u2019s economy.",
    "\u201cBased on staff analysis, the fiscal consolidation necessary to bring debt down to safe levels would require excessive adjustment over the coming years, pointing to a clear solvency problem,\u201d the IMF said.",
    "The full report provides further analysis of Sri Lanka\u2019s debt and finances. A summary of the report released earlier in the month said Sri Lanka faced unsustainable debt levels and needed a \u201ccredible and coherent\u201d strategy to restore stability.",
    "The country\u2019s \u201cdebt overhang,\u201d along with persistent fiscal and balance-of-payments shortfalls, \u201cwill constrain growth and jeopardize macroeconomic stability in both the near and medium term,\u201d the report said."
