    "The United Nations warned that cash-strapped Sri Lanka\u2019s unprecedented economic crisis could develop into a dire humanitarian crisis, with millions already in need of aid.",
    "\u201cWe are concerned that this could develop into a full-blown humanitarian emergency, and we are taking action to address that concern,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, told reporters.",
    "The UN and its partners are appealing for $47 million to address the immediate needs of the 1.7 million of the most vulnerable people and those most affected by the crisis, he said.",
    "Months of daily blackouts, long queues for petrol and record inflation have made daily life a misery in the South Asian island nation of 22 million people.",
    "The government has already defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt, and a critical shortage of foreign currency has left traders unable to import adequate supplies of food, fuel and other essential goods.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 was already taking a heavy toll, he said, pointing out that agriculture and livelihoods had been severely affected.",
    "Many people are now \u201cgoing without adequate food\u201d, Laerke said, also warning that \u201cfamilies\u2019 access to health services, protection and children\u2019s education is at stake.\u201d",
    "Unicef\u2019s representative in Sri Lanka Christian Skoog also warned that the situation was dire, with 17 percent of children under five in the country already malnourished and stunted before the crisis.",
    "He said the UN children\u2019s agency especially sought to help 56,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.",
    "\u201cPotentially they could all be at risk of dying,\u201d he told reporters via video link.",
    "Laerke highlighted that \u201cthe Sri Lankan economy is on the brink of collapse.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe call for international solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka.\u201d"
