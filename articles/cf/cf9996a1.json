  "body_lines": [
    "Acting Home Affairs Minister Jim Chalmers has announced that Tamil asylum seekers, the Nadesalingam family, will be allowed to return to the central Queensland town of Biloela.",
    "The family, also known as the Murugappans, will be able to return and live in the community on bridging visas while they await their case to be resolved in court.",
    "Nades, Priya and their two daughters, Kopika and Tharnicaa, have been in detention for the past four years after immigration officials detained them in 2018.",
    "The family were held on Christmas Island for two years before their youngest daughter was medically evacuated to Perth, where they have been in community detention since June 2021.",
    "It comes after Labor promised during the campaign that if it won the election, the Nadesalingam family would be allowed to return home to Biloela.",
    "In a statement, Mr Chalmers said he had spoken with the family and wished them well for their return.",
    "\u201cThis decision will allow them to get \u2018home to Bilo\u2019, a big-hearted and welcoming Queensland town that has embraced this beautiful family,\u201d he said.",
    "Mr Chalmers spoke to family friends Angela Fredericks, Bronwyn Dendle and other supporters on speakerphone in Biloela this afternoon.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve now spoken to the family, and they\u2019ve gone all through the processes at the Perth end,\u201d Mr Chalmers said.",
    "\u201cI really just wanted to ring you and tell you how much we appreciate the way that you\u2019ve spoken up for this beautiful family and for the great credit that you\u2019ve brought to that beautiful Queensland town of Biloela.\u201d",
    "\u201cObviously there\u2019s some arrangements to be made and all the rest of it but hopefully you get to see them soon.\u201d",
    "Supporters celebrate decision as family set to return to Biloela by June",
    "Supporters, friends and advocates said the decision was difficult to process.",
    "\u201cIt is just such an immense shock that this is finally happening. And as we\u2019ve said from the get-go, love will win,\u201d Ms Fredericks said.",
    "\u201cI think I\u2019m not going to believe it until their feet are on the ground here in Biloela and they\u2019re in my arms and I know that they\u2019re never going to go anywhere again unless they want to travel.\u201d",
    "Over the years, a group of tireless advocates championed their cause and what started as a local issue, grew into a national campaign.",
    "The \u201cHome to Bilo\u201d campaigners thanked \u201chundreds of thousands of Australians\u201d for their support over the past four years.",
    "\u201cWe know that this bridging visa is the start of this journey,\u201d Ms Fredericks said.",
    "\u201cWe know that there are more steps to take, however, we are so reassured by conversations that we\u2019ve had with so many members of parliament that this family are going to be able to be here permanently.",
    "Friend and advocate Bronwyn Dendle said the family would be home in Biloela by early June.",
    "\u201cThat will be just before Tharnicaa\u2019s fifth birthday,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt will be the first birthday she\u2019s had outside of Australia\u2019s detention system\u201d.",
    "\u201cWhat this campaign has done is actually humanise asylum seekers and it\u2019s got [people] talking about the danger of Tamils in Sri Lanka.\u201d",
    "Aran Mylvaganam from the Tamil Refugee Council said the community was happy with the minister\u2019s decision, but said there are thousands of Tamil refugees whose futures are uncertain.",
    "\u201cWe want the government to let everyone stay here permanently, we\u2019re only talking about 6,000 Tamil refugees who have been put through a flawed process by successive Australian governments and as a result they\u2019ve been denied protection visas,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe want the government to let these Tamil refugees stay here permanently.",
    "\u201cThere are many families like the Priya [and] Nades\u2019 family who have exhausted all the legal avenues and are living in fear of being deported back.",
    "Priya and Nades came to Australia separately by boat in 2012 and 2013 after fleeing war-torn Sri Lanka and were considered \u201cirregular maritime arrivals\u201d under the Migration Act.",
    "They were granted bridging visas while their cases were assessed and settled in Biloela, where they married and had their first child, Kopika, in 2015.",
    "The Nadesalingams became the public face of Australia\u2019s hardline stance on boat arrivals after a years-long immigration battle.",
    "For years, several politicians including conservatives Julie Bishop, Michael McCormack, Tony Abbott and Barnaby Joyce, have called on successive immigration ministers to use ministerial discretion to let the family return to Biloela, even though the parents\u2019 claims for refugee status had been rejected.",
    "The Department of Home Affairs under the former Liberal government had repeatedly said the Nadesalingam family\u2019s case had been comprehensively assessed over many years, and the family had consistently been found not to meet Australia\u2019s protection obligations."
