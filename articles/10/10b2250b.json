    "After the April 12 announcement Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka to \u2018C\u2019.",

We have affirmed Sri Lanka\u2019s Long-Term Local-Currency IDR at \u2018CCC\u2019, as the government has continued to service local-currency debt and we assume this will continue.

These scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank Governance Indicators have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model. Sri Lanka has a medium World Bank Governance Indicator ranking in the 46th percentile, reflecting a recent record of peaceful political transitions, a moderate level of rights for participation in the political process, moderate institutional capacity, established rule of law and a moderate level of corruption.",
    "ESG \u2013 Creditor Rights: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of \u20185\u2019 for Creditor Rights as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight.

    "Fitch\u2019s SRM is the agency\u2019s proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch\u2019s QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM.",
    "International scale credit ratings of Sovereigns, Public Finance and Infrastructure issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of three notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective Governance Indicators, this has a negative impact on the credit profile.",
