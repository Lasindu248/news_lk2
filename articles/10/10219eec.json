She said that Rs. 4.6 million was raised during the first phase from local and overseas donations and thanked all the donors who supported, saying that every rupee collected has been utilized to support the project.",
    "Amaratunga explained how the project was conceived after a personal encounter with the LRH when she took her daughter after taking her to many other hospitals. She said that this is not something that can be done individually and that everyone needs to help the hospital so that thousands of children can have corrective surgery for a brighter future for them and their families.",
    "She appealed to the media to carry the message across so that others who wish to support can either make a donation to Tarana or directly provide the required equipment to the Hospital.",
    "LRH doctors thanked the project in their speeches and explained that most of the corrective surgery needs to be done at an early stage to make them independent, otherwise the impact can be lifelong and appreciated the initiative taken by the Tarana Foundation to help the LRH with valuable implants and tools for the newly built Orthopaedic Surgery.",
    "The project helps those children who are from low socio-economic families having complicated orthopaedic issues to be cured of their deformities and disorders to lead normal lives. Donations can be made to Tarana Foundation, Children\u2019s Hospital Fund HNB A/C 003020850835."
