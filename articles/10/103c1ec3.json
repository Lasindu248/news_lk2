  "body_lines": [
    "At least 50 people, including five children, were killed after Russian forces carried out a missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that was being used by civilians trying to flee the fighting, Ukrainian officials said Friday.",
    "Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the regional military administration in Donetsk, where the attack took place, said that 98 wounded people -- 16 children, 46 were women and 36 men -- were taken to local hospitals.",
    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that nearly 300 people were wounded in the strike.",
    "In an address to Finland\u2019s parliament on Friday, Zelensky said that the \u201cRussian military hit the railway terminal,\u201d adding: \u201cThere are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of the missiles and dead people.\u201d",
    "He said that \u201cpeople (were) crowded waiting for the trains to be evacuated to the safe territory\u201d at the station. \u201cWhy do they need to hit civilians with missiles? Why this cruelty that the world has witnessed in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army?\u201d Zelensky asked lawmakers.",
    "Local police said in a statement that the rockets struck a temporary waiting room, where \u201chundreds of people were waiting for the evacuation train.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is another proof that Russia is brutally, barbarically killing the civilian Ukrainians, with one goal only -- to kill,\u201d the mayor of Kramatorsk said in a statement.",
    "The mayor said that some 8,000 people per day were going to the station to evacuate during the last two weeks. As many as 4,000 people were there when the missile struck.",
    "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attack a \u201cdeliberate slaughter.\u201d",
    "\u201cRussians knew that the train station in Kramatorsk was full of civilians waiting to be evacuated,\u201d he said.",
    "The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement Friday calling the missile strike a \u201cprovocation,\u201d in a statement that mirrored recent denials of the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.",
    "\u201cAll the statements of representatives of the Kyiv nationalist regime about the alleged \u2018missile attack\u2019 by Russia on April 8 at the railway station in Kramatorsk are a provocation and absolutely do not correspond to reality,\u201d the statement said.",
    "\u201cOn April 8, the Russian armed forces did not conduct or plan any artillery fires in the city of Kramatorsk. We emphasize that the Tochka-U tactical missiles, the wreckage of which was found near the Kramatorsk railway station and published by eyewitnesses, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces.\u201d",
    "Ukrainian forces have the Soviet-designed Tochka missile in their inventory but it has also been used by Russian and separatist forces in the past.",
    "Russia\u2019s military and senior officials have issued blanket denials of attacks against civilians, most recently claiming -- without evidence -- that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was staged. The killing of civilians during the Russian occupation of the town has been extensively documented.",
    "The eastern city of Kramatorsk was one of the first places to be targeted by the Russian military when the invasion of Ukraine was launched on February 24. Ihnatchenko said Ukrainians had been using the train station since late February to evacuate the region.",
    "\u201cThe Russians knew that thousands of people are there (at the train station) every day,\u201d she said.",
    "Two missiles struck the station, according to the head of Ukraine\u2019s national rail system, Oleksandr Kamyshin. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said the Russian military used Iskander short-range ballistic missiles.",
    "CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour said the attack was reminiscent of one on a marketplace in Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia, where \u201cordinary civilians were massacred as they just went about their business.\u201d",
    "Amanpour said such attacks on civilians tend to harden Western resolve and could push the European Union to enact even more sanctions on Russia. Brussels has already approved five rounds of sanctions against Russia since it invaded Ukraine.",
    "The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, condemned the \u201cindiscriminate attack,\u201d while EU President Charles Michel called it \u201chorrifying.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis is yet another attempt to close escape routes for those fleeing this unjustified war and cause human suffering,\u201d Borrell said.",
    "Borrell and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Zelensky this week in Kyiv.",
    "The attack comes as Russian forces are preparing for a massive operation in eastern Ukraine to take the contested region of Donbas, Ukrainian authorities say.",
    "Donbas is home to the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, two separatist enclaves that Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.",
    "For almost eight years, the two regions have been the site of a low-intensity war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. More than 14,000 people died in the fighting, and now Kyiv is bracing for more casualties.",
    "Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said the \u201cbattle for Donbas\u201d is already underway. He said that the fighting there will be reminiscent of the destructive battles during World War II, as Moscow\u2019s offensive could involve \u201cthousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes, artillery.\u201d",
    "British intelligence assesses that Russian troops have \u201cfully withdrawn\u201d from northern Ukraine to Belarus and Russia, and many could be transferred to eastern Ukraine to fight in Donbas. Ukrainian military officials also say they have observed a buildup of Russian forces to the east."
