    "COLOMBO (News 1st); JVP Leader & Opposition Lawmaker Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament on Thursday (7) that the opposition is prepared to consider any government proposal to address the present crisis, under one single condition, that is for the President to resign.",
    "\u201cThere are two main points centered around the struggle of the common people in Sri Lanka. One is that the present President must step down. We must accept it. This is not a call from the opposition or an MP. This is the call of the people. That is why they say Gota Go Home,\u201d said Dissanayake.",
    "He said the people are not prepared to accept any proposal within or out of the constitution, with the present President in power.",
    "\u201cWe can only consider a proposal from you (government), and submit proposals to you, under the condition that the President resigns,\u201d he told the Parliament.",
    "Thereafter, we can prepare a mechanism, be it a caretaker government, interim government, etc, that can be considered, said the JVP Leader.",
    "\u201cYou might recall in 2001, the parliament lost majority and we proposed to fulfill the suggestions and then we will support,\u201d he added.",
    "He went on to note that none of the proposals put forward by the President, will address the crises in the country.",
    "Chief Government Whip Johnston Fernando reiterated that the government will not resign, and the government is prepared to face any situation, and will NEVER go beyond the provisions of the constitution.",
