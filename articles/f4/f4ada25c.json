He also shared his life experience and examples on how to do mentoring and build your character when dealing with people in society.",
    "This was a day totally belongs to JEDB women without whose support and dedication JEDB wouldn\u2019t be where and what it is today. So as quoted by famous Pandits to all women \u201cYou are a Dreamer/Believer/Doer/Achiever and that She is You.\u201d",
