    "Therefore, the Minister said that only one fuel tanker is needed to manage the interim period between the Credit Lines.",
    "He stated that the Ministry of Energy is carrying out the necessary arrangements for the relevant Line of Credit.",
    "Although the Cabinet has approved a US $ 500 million loans from the Indian Exim Bank to purchase fuel, it is not clear if India approved the facility.",
    "The Exim Bank of India provided a loan of US $ 500 million to purchase fuel from the last week of March, followed by another US $ 200 million in May.",
    "The final oil tanker under the extended USD 200 million Line of Credit will arrive on the 16th.\u00a0Prior to the loan facility of US $ 500 million in March, agreements were signed with the Indian Oil Company to implement the Trincomalee Oil Tank Complex Project.",
    "Subsequently, by the time the loan of USD 200 million loan was finalized, agreements were drawn to implement the 500-megawatt Punerin and Mannar Renewable Energy Projects.",
    "Now, another $ 500 million is being requested to purchase fuel from India, yet the question is what will Sri Lanka have to sacrifice for this?",
    "What will happen to our country\u2019s fuel supply if the Exim Bank of India does not provide this $ 500 million loan facility?",

    "At the same time, concerns are mounting as to whether Sri Lanka will lose benefits by NOT engaging with Russia diplomatically.",
    "If there is no diplomatic engagement, shouldn\u2019t the government elaborate on the company that it will be selecting to deal in Rupees for Fuel, and the process that is adopted?",
