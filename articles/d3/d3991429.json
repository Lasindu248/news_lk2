    "Speaking on the Vote of Condolence on the slain MP, Rajapaksa said the peaceful struggle had been taken over by those with hidden agenda who were responsible for perpetuating violence.",
    "\u201cWhat wrong has the deceased MP done to anyone? He was an affable and humble man. The struggle of those who killed an innocent man like Amarakeerthi Athukorala cannot be defined as a peaceful struggle anymore. There is hatred in their hearts and blood on their hands,\u201d the former PM said.",
    "He said that many MPs have been killed tragically in the past, many of them at the hands of the LTTE and the groups linked to the JVP. \u201cPeople were protesting peacefully expressing their frustrations, but certain groups have taken advantage of this and turned this into a violent movement by killing people and burning houses,\u201d he said.",

    "SLPP MP Dulles Allahaperuma MP who spoke on the condolence vote said starting with the assassination of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956, the number of MPs murdered while holding office stands at 45.",
    "He said of these 24 have been Tamil MPs including the onetime leader of the Opposition A. Amirthalingam. In addition to this many others who were not elected but aspiring to be politicians such as Vijaya Kumaratunga and Rohana Wijeweera too were killed, he said.",
    "\u201cWe have to have an in-depth discussion on this culture of political assassinations for this country. Today it is Amarakeerthi Athukorala, tomorrow it could be Dulles Allahaperuma,\u201d he said."
