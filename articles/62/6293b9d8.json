    "The Trade Union alliance which just ended a hartal last Friday (06) pressuring President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the government to step down, had decided to go on a weeklong protest from Monday onwards. However, with the unprovoked attack taking place on Monday, the union collective decided to go for a continued hike from Tuesday onwards until President Rajapaksa stepped down, a spokesman said.",
    "Trade Union Alliance Convenor Ravi Kumudesh told reporters that the president must not delay his resignation.",
    "\u201cWe saw that former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa planned yesterday\u2019s assault that was unleashed on the peaceful protestors at Galle Face,\u201d said Kumudesh.",
    "\u201cWe ask the authorities to take action against Mahinda Rajapaksa and his paid thugs who started this and turned it to a war,\u201d he said.",
    "Violence erupted across Sri Lanka Monday evening and into the following day with crowds of people assaulting government MPs and setting fire to public and private property after supporters of Prime Minister Rajapaksa stormed two peaceful protest sites in Colombo and assaulted the protestors assembled. Eight people died in the violence that ensued islandwide and over 230 were injured, according to police.",
    "The trade unions had already gone on strike several times over the past months even before the \u201cGota go home\u201d protest that started early April.",
    "With more protests being organised island-wide against the current regime, unions also formed alliances to support the ongoing protests against the government.",
    "\u201cWe saw that even prisoners had been brought to [allegedly attack the protestors, a claim denied by the prison authorities]. We ask the security establishment to arrest the commissioner of prisons in this regard and question him.",
    "\u201cWe saw these political figures threatening innocent people coming from rural areas to join them. We demand they stop that as well,\u201d said Kumudesh.",
    "\u201cAnd we ask the president to go home without further delay,\u201d he added.",
