    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 An island-wide blackout is likely in Sri Lanka on Thursday (09) if an influential engineers union of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) makes good on a threat to walk out at midnight Wednesday (08) in protest of plans to entertain unsolicited bids from private investors bypassing competitive bidding.",
    "The union\u2019s chief demand is that the government withdraw proposed amendments to the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 that they say will facilitate such bids sans competitive bidding.",
    "The demands include a halt to plans to hand over Sri Lanka\u2019s wind and solar resources to India\u2019s Adani Group without bidding. Another notable demand is to \u201cstop driving the CEB to privatisation under the guise of reform\u201d.",
    "The engineers also want a new chairman for the CEB as soon as possible.",
    "\u201cRelevant authorities are requested to make necessary arrangements to take over the duties and responsibilities from the engineers by suitable competent personnel. If not all power plants, transmission and distribution networks will be safely shut down and all CEBEU members will leave the work place,\u201d a statement from the engineers\u2019 union said.",
    "The draft amendment to the Electricity Act is to be presented to parliament on Thursday.",
    "Talks between union leaders and Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara failed and, according to union leaders who spoke to the media, they will go ahead with the planned strike.",
