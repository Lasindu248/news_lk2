    "Sri Lanka has informed the British Government rejecting the latest travel advisory issued by the United Kingdom on Sri Lanka, Foreign Secretary Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage said today.",
    "He told the online news conference organised by the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) that the Foreign Ministry also submitted a letter to the British High Commission in Colombo clarifying the facts mentioned in the travel advisory.",
    "He said issuing advisories of this nature was not a new thing and that such advisories have been issued over the years.",
    "He said, however, that the advisory on a possible terrorist attack was a matter of concern and pointed out that it was just an assumption and terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in the world.",
    "\"It is mentioned in the advisory that terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka. This is a matter of concern for us. It is just an assumption. Such attacks could happen anywhere in the world. If they have any intelligence information on a terrorist attack, they should inform us,\" he said and added that \"We have informed the UK Government through the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in the United Kingdom that the facts mentioned in the advisory are wrong. We never know whether they will correct it or not,\" he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)"
