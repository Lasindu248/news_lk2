    "The law fraternity has decided to bring in an impeachment motion against the Attorney General through some members of Parliament, MP Wijedasa Rajapaksha said today.",
    "\u201cIt is not only the legislature and the Executive who are responsible for the present crisis in the country but the Judiciary too is responsible,\u201d Rajapaksha told Parliament.",
    "\u201cThe law fraternity is of the opinion that the Attorney General had failed in his duty when it comes to certain cases. The case on the Malwana mansion is facing an end as the Attorney General had failed to submit evidence to the judiciary. Therefore the law fraternity which feels that the Attorney General has failed in his duties are planning to bring in an impeachment motion against him through the legislature,\u201d Rajapaksha said.",
    "\u201cThe situation today demands that Parliament and President has to fulfil what is being demanded by the people. President should understand that people want him to resign. There is no Finance Minister. May be a new Minister of Finance is not appointed as the Treasury is empty. I have come up with a proposal to resolve the crisis. Kindly give a consideration\u00a0 to it,\u201d he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)"
