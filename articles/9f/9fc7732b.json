  "body_lines": [
    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 The head of Sri Lanka\u2019s Catholic Church Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith left to the Vatican Friday morning with a 60-member delegation including families of the 2019 Easter attack victims on an invitation of Pope Francis.",
    "Spokesman of the Archdiocese of Colombo Fr Cyril Gamini told EconomyNext on Friday that the Pope had conveyed to the Cardinal his solidarity with the community in Sri Lanka\u2019s moment of crisis.",
    "Pope Francis will bless the families of Easter Sunday victims at a mass at the St Peter\u2019s basilica. He is also scheduled to hold discussions with the Sri Lankan delegation regarding the tragedy and the progress of investigations into it, said Fr Gamini.",
    "April 21 marked the third anniversary of the Easter bombings that killed 269 and injured over 500. At a ceremony commemorating the event, the Cardinal suggested that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s ascendency to power was a plot backed by military intelligence officials.",
    "Sri Lanka Cardinal puts Rajapaksa in the dock over Easter attacks",
    "Cardinal Ranjith and Sri Lanka\u2019s opposition have been crying foul over what they claim is delayed justice for the victims and their families. The former has on several occasions alleged a politically motivated conspiracy.",
    "\u201cWe are pushing the government through international communications and organisations like the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to carry out a proper investigation and unveil the truth,\u201d said Fr Gamini.",
    "Protestors at the Galle Face green in Colombo, who have been demanding the resignation of President Rajapaksa and his government over Sri Lanka\u2019s worsening economic crisis, have also joined the chorus of voices demanding justice for the Easter victims.",
    "The belief that the incumbent administration came to power on \u201cthe blood of the victims\u201d is becoming increasingly entrenched, with or without evidence to support it, analysts say. (Colombo/Apr22/2022)"
