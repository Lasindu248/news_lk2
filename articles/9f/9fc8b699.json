    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka government\u2019s foreign exchange debt payments are up to date including a large tranche of dollar denominated bonds that matured in March which have been re-financed, Central Bank Governor Nivard Cabraal said.",
    "\u201cAs of today there are no government outstandings to be paid,\u201d Cabraal said on March 21.",
    "In the first quarter of 2022 Sri Lanka has to settle about 3,001 million US dollars worth forex denominated debt out of a total of 6,900 million US dollars, according to available data.",
    "On March 16, 54.4 million US dollars and on March 17, 419.34 million dollars owned by domestic investors matured.",
    "\u201cWe have repaid everyone and most have re-invested,\u201d Cabraal said.  \u201cThere were also some new investors. A very small amount we repaid with other financing.\u201d",
    "Sri Lanka is paying higher rates to domestic investors for SLDB and they are also issued in smaller denominations of 1,000 US dollars expanding the domestic investors.",
    "Earlier in March an auction for 50 million dollars of SLDB\u2019s brought sales of 150 million dollars.",
    "Sri Lanka is facing forex shortages due to liquidity injected into a pegged exchange rate regime to keep rates. The new liquidity creates a demand for dollars exceeding inflows, undermining the credibility of the peg and making forex reserve go down when the peg is defended.",
    "In March an attempt was made to shift to a floating regime to stop reserve sales for imports and match inflows to outflows, but the float has not yet got established. (Colombo/Mar22/2022)"
