    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial banks quoted the rupee at 330/340 for telegraphic transfers on April 21, flat over four days, while the interbank spot was mostly inactive, market participants said.",
    "The central bank\u2019s indicative spot was quoted at 335 rupees against the US dollar on Thursday.",
    "On Thursday, the central bank\u2019s telegraphic transfer rate was 327.5/339.99 against the US dollar, remaining the same as Wednesday.",
    "Exporters and importers were matching deals at higher than small volume TT rate and negotiated forward trades were also taking place, financial market sources said.",
    "In bond markets, bill yields fell after part of an auction was rejected.",
    "However, the three-month bill was quoted at 20.30/21 percent and the one-year bill was quoted at 22.30/23 percent, both easing from the previous day\u2019s auction yields as interest in Treasuries was kindled.",
    "At the weekly bills auction, although the debt office only sold 45.15 billion out of the offered 97.5 billion rupees, yields rose across all maturities.",
    "Bond markets expect more money to flow in at higher rates, helping fund the deficit and reduce money printing. Sri Lanka\u2019s rupee is under severe pressure due to earlier money printing and an existing surrender rule.",
    "But a hike in the policy rate and adjusting market rates will reduce domestic private credit and demand, slowing economic activity and imports. (Colombo/Apr21/2022)"
