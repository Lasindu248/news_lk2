    "Speaking during a press conference Mr. Wijewardene said the time has come for the opposition members to forget their personal political dreams. \"Some members of the opposition think and work thinking they are going to become future presidents. It is time to forget these personal dreams,\" he said.",
    "Referring to the Rambukkana killing, the UNP Deputy Leader said eye witnesses had informed him that protesters did not engage in any form of violence. \"I met some of the eye witnesses and they said the person who was killed never engaged in violence,\" he said.",
    "He also said what the country is experiencing is an uprising of the common masses and not just youth unrest. \"Labeling the protest as youth uprising will justify the suppression,\" he said. (Yohan Perera)"
