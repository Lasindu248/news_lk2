    "National Movement for Social Justice Chairman and former speaker Karu Jayasuriya has urged the Government to urgently heed the message of the people\u2019s struggle or the Aragalaya at GoGotaGama which marked its 50th day on Saturday.",
    "He said 28 May marked the 50th day of the struggle for democracy launched by the country\u2019s youth and its people at the Galle Face Green in Colombo. It is a struggle as never seen before in Sri Lanka where the people have arisen to fight for their rights.",
    "\u201cThose engaged in the struggle have managed to achieve much more than any other political or civil movement in this country has been able to in recent times. They are also successfully advocating for many political and economic reforms that must now take place in this country. All Sri Lankans who value democracy must give them the due recognition for their untiring efforts. We, the National Movement for Just Society, would like to join hands with them at this moment to express our deep regard and appreciation for them,\u201d Jayasuriya said.",
    "\u201cIt must be highly appreciated that the aspirations of the just people of this country for a free, independent and peaceful country are being highlighted by the youth and the civil society groups involved in this struggle. The government must therefore heed their genuine calls without further ado. The Sri Lankan society must understand that this country cannot achieve a better future without securing the political and civil rights of its people,\u201d Jayasuriya added."
