    "COLOMBO (News 1st); A special operation mounted by Sri Lanka Navy in the eastern seas on Wednesday morning (15th June 2022) led to the apprehension of 64 persons who were suspected to be attempting to illegally migrate from the country via sea routes.",
    "Accordingly, the Fast Attack Craft P 484 of the Fast Attack Flotilla attached to the Eastern Naval Command intercepted a suspicious local fishing trawler, during a patrol off Trincomalee this morning (15th June). Upon being searched, the Navy apprehended 64 persons, believed to be illegal immigrants heading to a foreign country by sea, along with the fishing trawler used for the illegal activity. Among the apprehended individuals were 50 males including 07 persons involved in this racket, 11 females and 03 children, who were from 02 to 55 years of age.",
    "The suspects held in this naval patrol are residents of Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Jaffna. They will be handed over to the Trincomalee Harbour Police for onward legal proceedings.",
    "The Navy urges the public to avoid being convicted before the law by being caught in the trap of smugglers who persuade the innocent to engage in illegal and perilous sea voyages to migrate from the island. It has been continuously observed ruinous fishing vessels are being used for such journeys and they are not at all seaworthy. As such, the Navy warns the public that attempting to migrate by these vessels could pose a high risk to their lives."
