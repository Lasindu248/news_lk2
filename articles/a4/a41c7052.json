    "The Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) yesterday reiterated abolishing the executive presidency will help put in place many reforms and improve transparency. The prevalent crisis provides an ideal platform to get the process underway, and parliament should take immediate steps to do so, the party adds.",
    "Addressing a media briefing yesterday, SJB parliamentarian Eran Wickramaratne, said his party has an immediate plan of action to diffuse the current crisis, and will take steps to provide greater freedom to the Central Bank, the Commission to Invest Allegations of Bribery and Corruption and the Attorney General\u2019s Department.",
    "He added the Government did not heed warnings of the coming crisis and contributed to the prevalent situation and forced suffering upon the public. Wickramaratne said that if in office, the SJB would obtain bridging finance from friendly nations, restructure debt and deploy a social security scheme to safeguard vulnerable groups. He said the opposition has already engaged multilateral agencies on these matters and will also move swiftly to offer stability to the banking system.",
    "\u201cWe need to provide food, medicines and power first to our people. We have already begun discussions with multilateral agencies, and we have a plan on how to overcome these issues. We can only embark on reforms after these critical aspects are handled. These are things the Government can do now. It doesn\u2019t matter who does it, but it has to happen, and the Government can do these faster as they are in office. Part of these issues today are because the current regime took away the independence of the Central Bank. The Government still makes a hue and cry of the bond scam, so why have they not filed a case against anyone?\u201d Wickramaratne said.",
    "Joining the briefing, parliamentarian S.M. Marikkar said the Government was still focused on suppressing the people and questioned the move to impose curfew and emergency regulations. He noted that the Government is unable to stop people from taking to the streets and questioned if the Government will arrest all people if they continue to agitate from their homes. The people are today all in one camp and that is bigger than the Government, he said, calling on the President and the Government to heed the calls of protestors to \u2018go home\u2019 and take accountability for their actions. He charged that the declaration of emergency and curfew was all to protect one family and not the nation.",
    "SJB MP Rohini Kavirathne, said: \u201cToday there is no Minister for Finance nor a Secretary to the Ministry. How can the state machinery function when there is no leadership or responsibility? Government MPs claim they have left their Ministries and resigned. Then why are they still using vehicles and resources afforded by their ministries? They then need to hand these back. Yesterday, there were masked riders harassing people at protests. It is said these are army personnel, but is it? These are civil matters. This is a disgrace to the army also.\u201d",
    "Kavirathne added that it was reported the president had visited parliament yesterday, and if he visits the house, it would be useful for him to come down to the chamber and respond to questions from representatives of the people. The country and economy have been mismanaged by the Government, she charged, alongside no visible and clear foreign policy which has led to a breakdown in confidence amongst all stakeholders."
