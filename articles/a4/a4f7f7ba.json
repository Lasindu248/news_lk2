  "body_lines": [
    "The export earnings in Sri Lanka\u2019s clothing sector for the June to August period are set to fall by 20-25 percent, with the sector likely to miss the US $ 6 billion export target for the year, as the country\u2019s political and economic crisis continues unabated.",
    "Sri Lanka\u2019s Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Secretary General Yohan Lawrence told Just Style that in terms of the value, this is \u201cnearly a loss of US $ 125 million per month for the next three months\u201d.",
    "A loss of buyers\u2019 confidence in the industry because of the \u201cpolitical instability\u201d is a real risk, he said. With apparel accounting for on average 40 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s total export revenue, there is an urgent need to maintain buyers\u2019 confidence in the industry adding \u201cthe perceived threat to the sector\u201d has been very damaging.",
    "Moreover, the lack of a steady supply of energy is affecting small to medium-scale apparel makers although Sri Lanka\u2019s large apparel manufacturers have managed to continue production because they \u201chave been among the most effective adopters of renewable energy technology, particularly solar energy\u201d. Lawrence is urging the government to \u201csecure bridge financing\u201d immediately until there is a definite timeline on an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.",
    "Lawrence said JAAF is pressing the government to \u201cimmediately commence discussions with credible policy and industry experts towards rapid development of a practical, apolitical \u2018Roadmap for Sri Lanka\u2019s Economic Recovery\u2019\u201d. While there are ongoing efforts to get bilateral funding, \u201cit is nowhere near enough\u201d, he said adding, \u201cThis is a very real problem\u201d, that needs sorting.",
    "With foreign reserves down to almost nothing, imports have come to a near standstill. That said, the supply of imported raw materials needed for the apparel export sector has so far continued to flow. This is because the sector has been allowed to use money from export earnings to buy raw material inputs.",
    "\u201cSo, we have been using part of our inward remittances [export revenue] as outward remittances to buy the raw materials we need and the balance of the money will be converted to local currency,\u201d Lawrence added.\u00a0 (www.Just-Style.com)"
