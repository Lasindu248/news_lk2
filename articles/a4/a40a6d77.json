    "Ceylinco Life has resumed its \u2018Waidya Hamuwa\u2019 (Meet the doctor) community health programme with its first free medical camp for 2022 in the Trincomalee district.",
    "The camp, organised by Ceylinco Life\u2019s Kantale branch, benefitted 152 people who mostly belonged to the local farming community and have limited access to diagnostics and preventive healthcare. They were provided free access to doctors and checkups, and where necessary, health screenings and tests.",
    "The medical camp took place at the Raja Maha Viharaya in Dehiwatta Seruwawila, Trincomalee, and conducted 79 fasting blood sugar and random blood sugar tests, 57 tests for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cholesterol, and 34 electrocardiograms (ECGs).",
    "The camp provided visiting doctors the opportunity to diagnose patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and such non-communicable diseases, which, if left unchecked, can become worse and even fatal, the Company said. It also enabled patients to learn of the diagnoses and gave them the information needed to make better lifestyle choices to manage the diseases.",
    "The \u2018Waidya Hamuwa\u2019 programme was on a hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ceylinco Life said it plans to conduct a series of these programmes in other parts of the country as the year progresses. Approximately 166 manhours were invested in the organising of this first medical camp for the year.",
