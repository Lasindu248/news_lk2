    "Food importers had brought good to feed the people on credit since banks were not giving enough dollars and many companies were in trouble after the rupee fell in March in a botched float.",
    "\u201cThe suppliers just trust us and send the goods to Sri Lanka (without LCs),\u201d Senevirtne said. \u201cThat has been hampered for the last six months and there is a problem of continued supply.\u201d",
    "He said suppliers are reluctant to ship and are asking for money upfront.",

    "\u201cNow importers are faced with 50 million dollars (of supplies credit) which we have already sold. So they are facing banktruptcy.\u201d  (Colombo/April24/2022)"
