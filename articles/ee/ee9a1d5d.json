    "TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran has slammed the Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) saying that Jeewan Thondaman broke away from the Rajapaksa government only after the party knew that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would be sacked.",
    "He said the CWC aligned with the government in enjoying ministerial portfolios when Tamil people were killed and suppressed.",
    "\u201cI doubt if Jeewan Thondaman would have taken such a decision if Mahinda Rajapaksa was so strong at this point. Some have made it a habit to go after political power and perks,\" Sumanthiran said. (Ajith Siriwardena)"
