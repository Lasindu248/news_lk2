    "(News 1st); China should not to become \u201ctoo closely aligned\u201d with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, the head of UK cyber-intelligence GCHQ has warned.",
    "Sir Jeremy Fleming said China\u2019s long-term interests are not served by an alliance with Moscow.",
    "In a rare public address during a visit to Australia, Sir Jeremy also said Russia had \u201cmassively misjudged\u201d the situation in Ukraine.",
    "He said Vladimir Putin\u2019s advisers are \u201cafraid to tell him the truth\u201d.",
    "Sir Jeremy said China\u2019s aspirations to become a leading player on the global stage were \u201cnot well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores\u201d international rules.",
    "The speech at the Australian National University in Canberra comes after Downing Street said Boris Johnson had a \u201cfrank and candid\u201d discussion with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping last week.",
    "Sir Jeremy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a clear \u201cstrategic choice\u201d to align with China as it grows more powerful in opposition to the United States.",
    "He said the Kremlin regards China in the current crisis as a supplier of weapons, technology, and a potential market for its oil and gas.",
    "But Sir Jeremy suggested President Xi has a \u201cmore nuanced\u201d view of the relationship.",
    "\u201cRussia understands that, long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, echoing comments from US and Ukrainian officials, the GCHQ boss said Mr Putin \u201cunderestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise.",
    "\u201cHe under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory.\u201d",
    "However, Sir Jeremy said \u201cthe extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime\u201d."
