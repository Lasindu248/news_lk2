    "Former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, said that what the President meant was that the IMF should have assisted Sri Lanka earlier, rather than the country approaching the international organization earlier.",
    "He also said that it is a process which takes time, and mentioned that although it was discussed amongst Cabinet Ministers several times, both decisions to approach or not to approach did not give any clear results.",
    "Rajapaksa added that it is possible that Sri Lanka may face conditions in the future with regard to the program.",
    "However, in January , the Minister remained in the stance that\u00a0the country will be developed without seeking the assistance of the IMF, as the\u00a0IMF is not going to strengthen the country economically.",
    "He later changed his stance in February , saying that\u00a0Sri Lanka was preparing to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its expertise amidst the prevailing economic crisis."
