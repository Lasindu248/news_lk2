  "body_lines": [
    "Regarding the video footage circulating on social media in which a container was seen transporting under the STF security personnel, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) clarified that it was routine practice to provide security to such containers as they contain atomic substances.",
    "According to the video, it shows several container trucks were exiting from the Jaya Container Terminal escorted by STF personnel.",
    "While issuing a notice, the SLPA said that the container contained atomic substances that were re-exported under the permission of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Regulatory Council (SLAERC) for the purpose of destruction.",
    "They said such missions are conducted with the presence of the STF personnel. Therefore, the SLPA requested the people not to misunderstand the misinformation circulating in social media. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)"
