    "ECONOMYNEXT \u2013 Lanka IOC, the Indian Oil Corporation unit in Sri Lanka raised petrol prices by 35 rupees a litre and diesel by 75 rupees from the mid night of Sunday amid sharp depreciation of the currency and high global oil prices.",
    "Since the central bank on March 7 announced a flexible exchange rate, the rupee has fallen over 65 percent to around 335 rupees. The Lanka IOC already raised priced on March 11 and March 26.",
    "The latest price hike will see the price of mostly used Octane 92 rising by 11.6 percent to a record 338 rupees a litre while auto diesel going up by 35 percent to 289 rupees.",
    "The Lanka IOC has been raising fuel prices in line with the global market price. It has increased prices four time since mid last year. The state owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Ceypetco) has yet to raise the prices in line with the Lanka IOC prices.",
    "The Ceypetco has raised mostly used Octane 92 price to 254 rupees last month after the central bank allowed flexible exchange rate while auto diesel price was increased to 176 rupees per litre.",
    "Already many motorists turn to Ceypetco fuel stations for auto diesel which is sold 38 rupee less compared to Lanka IOC price before the latest price hike, resulting in huge queues amid fuel shortage across the country.",
    "The Ceypetco has said it is facing a risk of heavy loss as the world crude oil price has been on the rise after the Russian bombing in Ukraine.",
    "The Ceypetco chairman Sumith Wijesinghe on April 11 said the state-owned fuel retailer was losing between 800 to 1000 billion rupees a day as it was losing 110 rupees per litre of diesel sold and 52 rupees for a litre of petrol.",
    "When prices are not raised and losses are financed with banks credit, which are in turn re-financed by the central bank through its 13.5 percent window, inflation goes up. The money printed to finance losses also creates forex shortages.",
    "The dollar shortage has led to lack of fuel and extended power cuts, crippling many industries related to manufacturing and transport, disrupting the country\u2019s economic activities. (Colombo/April 18/2022)"
