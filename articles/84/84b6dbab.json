    "It also clarified an allegation made during a discussion held with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, a group of Ministers, Trade Union Leaders and Heads of State institutions on Wednesday.",
    "\u201cThe main reason for the medicines shortage was the foreign exchange crisis, which has also affected the supply of essential commodities,\u201d the statement said, adding that all matters were outside the purview of the Authority.",
    "It also said the allegations levelled over the delay in the release of medicines and equipment are baseless. The NMRA also denied allegations pertaining to local manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices being discouraged.",
