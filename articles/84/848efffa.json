    "''A bad neighbor is a misfortune ,as much as a good one is a great blessing.'' This means that every country needs a good neighbour with friendly relations, which is essential to maintain peace and progress of a country. A friendly relation with the adjoining countries is absolutely integral due to the reasons like it enhances internal development, helps exchange thoughts and ideas, develops good trade relation with exports and imports and facilitates military aid in times of emergency.",
    "The classic example, which literally reflects the significance of maintaining a good relation with neighbouring countries can be seen in what transpired in Ukraine recently. As we all know, Russia started to invade Ukraine which was in fact out of the blue. The whole world was closely monitoring the situation; however, Ukraine did not get much of a support from its neighbouring countries except from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy. Nevertheless, none of these countries gave no military support to Ukraine which was the need of the hour for them. If Ukraine had received more useful aid from other countries, the situation would have been different and perhaps, more peaceful.",
    "As far as the situation in Sri Lanka is concerned, the country is currently confronting its worst economic crisis since Independence. This is an issue triggered by the mismanagement of economic policies, lack of proper action plan during COVID-19 pandemic and certain irrational decisions such as deep tax cuts in 2019 etc. Now, the economic collapse has culminated in foreign exchange reserve crisis, rising inflation and cost of living, spiralling shortages of everything from diesel to almost all food items and deprecating currency. Besides, the situation is exacerbated by political turmoil and unprecedented wave of spontaneous protests.",
    "Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka is desperately looking for help especially financial aid from other countries. As such, India which has always become Sri Lanka\u2019s best neighbour has come forward and pledged assistance. India is a peace loving country and it has aimed to develop good relations with its neighbours. Since the inception of India\u2019s Foreign Policy, it aims at a peaceful and friendly relationship with its neighbours. India and Sri Lanka have a legacy of intellectual, cultural, religious and linguistic interaction and the relationship between two countries is more than 2500 years old. Trade and investment have grown and there is cooperation in the fields of development, education, culture and defence. Both countries share a broad understanding on major issues of international interest.",
    "Given the current crisis situation, Sri Lanka now increasingly depends on its northern neighbour for basic stuff like fuel, medicine, and food items. India has already extended credit lines and currency swaps worth over $3 billion to Sri Lanka in order to help it come out of this economic mess. New Delhi also continues to defer seeking repayment of at least $2 billion in dues owed through the Asian Clearing Union.",
    "Meanwhile, a large humanitarian grant assistance consignment worth more than SLR 2 billion from the people of India is scheduled to reach Colombo on May 22, 2022. The consignment, which consists of 9,000 MT of rice, 50 MT of milk powder and more than 25 MT of drugs and other medical supplies, will be handed over by High Commissioner Gopal Baglay to the senior leadership of Government of Sri Lanka.",
    "The consignment was flagged off from Chennai port by Thiru M.K Stalin, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on May 18, 2022. This is the first incoming consignment under a larger commitment of 40,000 MT of rice, 500 MT of milk powder and medicines by Government of Tamil Nadu. This commitment translates to more than SLR 5.5 billion.",
    "Besides, the incoming consignment shall be distributed among beneficiaries across the country including Northern, Eastern, Central and Western Provinces by Government of Sri Lanka. These beneficiaries cover diverse sections of the society.",
    "The assistance from people of India complements multi-pronged efforts undertaken by Government of India by standing with their brethren in Sri Lanka. Several private and social organizations from India have sent assistance to Sri Lanka to meet various urgent requirements. This outpouring of support for Sri Lanka among common Indians is apart from the economic assistance by Government of India which has been to the tune of around USD 3.5 billion since January this year. In addition, medicines, dry rations etc have also been sent by Government of India on grant basis.",
    "It is also fitting to note the political relations shared by two countries apart from financial aids. Political relations between the two countries have been marked by high-level exchanges of visits at regular intervals.",
    "In conclusion, there is no doubt that the support extended by India will definitely help Sri Lanka ease the pressure and return to normalcy. Last but not least, all the aid was down to the long lasting relationship maintained by the both countries over decades."
