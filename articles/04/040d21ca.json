    "Amidst rising rumours that Central Bank Governor Ajith Cabraal has been told to resign from his position by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa amidst the severe economic crisis and his continuous denials of seeking IMF assistance, Cabraal last evening told Daily Mirror that these rumours were wrong and he had not received any such request.",
    "\"There is no truth in that rumour,\" Cabraal said, re-affirming that he will continue in his functions as the Central Bank chief. In recent days, there has been an obvious lapse of communication or even a possible rift signalled between the President and the Central Bank Chief as Cabraal had denied going to the IMF for debt restructuring. Following reports that IMF officials would visit the island this week, Cabraal last week said that meetings with IMF officials and Sri Lankan authorities over the next few weeks were not for the purpose of debt restructuring as stated by some news agencies.",
    "However, President Rajapaksa in his speech last evening said he was in discussion with the IMF and he had decided to work with them after examining the advantages and disadvantages.(JAMILA HUSAIN)"
