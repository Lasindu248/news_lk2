    "The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) hinted that it would also increase the price of fuel after Monday (14), as soon as the queues at fuel stations and powercuts are over, Samagi United Trade Union Force (SUTUF) Convenor and media spokesman Ananda Palitha said.",
    "He told the Daily Mirror that the reason for not increasing the price of fuel is, that the government fears that the fury of the general public could intensify further.",
