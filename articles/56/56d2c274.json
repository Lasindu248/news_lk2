    "The inaugural event was held recently targeting female SME entrepreneurs in the Southern Province and primarily focused on educating participants on how to become a seller on Daraz through live demonstrations and hands-on training on the process to be followed, from registration and seller verification to marketing of products through the e-commerce application.",
    "Commenting on the initiative, Daraz Sri Lanka Head of Marketplace Saed Meera said: \u201cTraining SME entrepreneurs on e-commerce operations, particularly about \u2018How to sell on Daraz\u2019, will allow them to tap into Daraz\u2019s base of more than 2 million customers, and reach a wider market than they currently have access to while selling offline. Selling on Daraz can help small businesses and home-grown entrepreneurs overcome market challenges and the high selling and delivery costs, while enabling them to take better advantage of the emerging growth opportunities within the digital economy.\u201d",
