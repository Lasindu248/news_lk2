    "The Brandix apparel manufacturing facility in Batticaloa is the theme of a recently released short film titled \u2018Enriching the fabric of community\u2019, produced for Brandix by BBC StoryWorks Commercial Productions. This film is part of the \u2018Building a Better Future\u2019 series, presented by the World Green Building Council and explores the profound effect buildings have on the quality of people\u2019s lives and the role the green buildings movement plays in tackling climate change.",
    "Brandix Essentials, Batticaloa achieved the status of the World\u2019s 1st Net Zero Carbon certified apparel manufacturing facility in 2019, signifying that this factory eliminated its negative environmental impact through emission reduction, thereby playing its part to challenge climate change. This factory is also rated Platinum in the prominently recognised Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System programme of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).",
    "Brandix understands the need for not only environmental, but also, social sustainability to ensure truly transformative change across the apparel industry. The company has implemented multiple \u2018Care for Our Own\u2019 community programmes to ensure access to clean drinking water for employees and others in the community, toward leading healthier lives. At present, over 4,500 families benefit from access to clean drinking water, with other beneficiaries including institutions such as schools and hospitals.",
    "\u201cAt Brandix we believe in an integrated approach of embedding sustainability in every aspect of our operation \u2013 care for our planet and the communities in which we operate in is at the heart of everything we do.\u201d says Ashroff Omar, Group Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThe fashion industry has experienced a noticeable shift in perception in recent years, with research indicating it is a significant polluter. Our sustainability journey began over a decade ago to consistently stay at the forefront of efforts to adopt best practices for environmentally and socially sustainable manufacturing. Green buildings such as our facility in Batticaloa exemplify this. It enables us to preserve the environment, rather than harm, while also ensuring a healthy and productive atmosphere for all our employees.\u201d",
    "The short film \u201cEnriching the fabric of community\u201d produced for Brandix by BBC StoryWorks Commercial Productions, tells the remarkable tale of the factory in Batticaloa that proves as a benchmark for a green building that is 100% powered by solar energy, recycles or reuses all waste, and has highly efficient water systems in place. The materials used in construction minimise heat gain of the building, and the rich biodiversity around the facility allows for a comfortable work environment that improves the overall wellbeing of employees. Through the lens of a Brandix employee \u2013 Sutharshini, the film takes the viewer through challenges she faced in her personal life, and how the efforts of Brandix have eased the issues.",
    "\u201cEnriching the fabric of community\u201d can be viewed on all Brandix social media platforms across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn.",
    "Brandix has committed to the World Green Building Council that all factories located in Sri Lanka, under the company\u2019s direct control, will achieve Net Zero Carbon status by 2023. Brandix hopes that this short film, will inspire more organisations to join hands and stitch sustainability and care for the community, into the very fabric of business.",
