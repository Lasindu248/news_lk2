    "GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters): The head of the World Health Organisation on Tuesday urged countries to maintain surveillance of coronavirus infections, saying the world was \u201cblind\u201d to how the virus is spreading because of falling testing rates.",
    "\u201cAs many countries reduce testing, WHO is receiving less and less information about transmission and sequencing,\u201d Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference at the UN agency\u2019s headquarters in Geneva. \u201cThis makes us increasingly blind to patterns of transmission and evolution.\u201d",
    "FIND, a global aid group working with WHO on expanding access to testing chief executive Bill Rodriguez said: \u201ctesting rates have plummeted by 70 to 90%.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe have an unprecedented ability to know what is happening. And yet today, because testing has been the first casualty of a global decision to let down our guard, we are becoming blind to what is happening with this virus,\u201d he said."
