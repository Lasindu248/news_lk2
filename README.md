## [20:13] Present govt. too has the same swing door policy of Mahinda Rajapaksa: Johnston

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Present-govt-too-has-the-same-swing-door-policy-of-Mahinda-Rajapaksa-Johnston/108-232530](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Present-govt-too-has-the-same-swing-door-policy-of-Mahinda-Rajapaksa-Johnston/108-232530)

Chief Government Whip and Highways Minister Johnston Fernando said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government too has the same swing door’ policy of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa so that anyone could leave or join the government as they wish.

Speaking at a ceremony to declare the opening of a new building complex for Narammala Pradeshiya Sabha, the Minister said that all those within the government should understand that they have a role in protecting it. “One cannot be in the government while playing the role of the Opposition. The President had to remove two ministers because they overlooked their responsibility as government ministers and played the role of the Opposition. They must understand that the government still adhered to the saloon-door policy referred to by the incumbent Prime Minister," the Minister said.

“We have won Kurunegala district at past elections because Mahinda Rajapaksa was in our party. People voted for this government because of him. People respect the political leaders in the government because they respect the party which Mahinda Rajapaksa represents. I remember how he brought Gotabaya Rajapaksa to the Sugathadasa Stadium and introduced him to people as his youngest brother and called on them to vote for him. People voted for him and his government because they trusted Prime Minister Rajapaksa. They had realized the mistake they had committed in 2015. That was why Gotabaya Rajapaksa could defeat Sajith Premadasa who had the backing of forces in the North, the East and the blessings of the international forces.

“If Mahinda Rajapaksa continued as the President of the country without the 2015 regime change, this country would have faced any crisis including the global pandemic successfully The government that came to power in 2015 destroyed the economy Mahinda Rajapaksa built. They destroyed the national security and that was the main cause of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. That was when the dwindling of the dollar reserves started. Finally by the time we took over, the country was fighting with Afghanistan to avoid becoming the lowest economy in the region. What we experience today are the results of that reality," the minister added.

“We have imported necessary stocks of fuel and distribution has been streamlined and top priority has been given to filling stations. The fuel shortage would be resolved within 24 hours. We call on people not to panic or fall for the Opposition’s tactics because there would be enough fuel,” the Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

## [19:09] Cardinal requests UNHRC to support an impartial investigation

## [17:31] Power-cut hours to be trimmed: PUCSL Chairman

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Power-cut-hours-to-be-trimmed-PUCSL-Chairman/108-232527](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Power-cut-hours-to-be-trimmed-PUCSL-Chairman/108-232527)

There is a tendency in reducing the number of power shedding hours by at least two hours with the presence of sufficient diesel and furnace oil and until we get enough rain, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Rathnayaka said.

He said within two or three days we will receive adequate fuel for power generation in the country.

We have received a 30,000 MT furnace oil shipment today and the unloading process will start by tomorrow, he said.

We have sufficient coal in hand to operate the coal power plants. After once the adequate fuel arrives, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) would generate 2,100 MW of electricity including 5 GW from hydropower which sufficient for the daily usage.

"With the 900 MW from Norochcholei power plant and another 1,200 MW from operating plants with the use of furnace oil and naptha, we can generate about 2,100 MW of electricity," he said.

Therefore, we would be able to trim the number of power shedding hours in the future. However, the power shedding has to be continued until the country receives adequate rainfall, the Chairman said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## [14:53] Autopsy shows Shane Warne died of natural causes, Thai police say

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Autopsy-shows-Shane-Warne-died-of-natural-causes-Thai-police-say/108-232518](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Autopsy-shows-Shane-Warne-died-of-natural-causes-Thai-police-say/108-232518)

An autopsy showed the death last week of Australian cricket great Shane Warne on an island in Thailand was due to natural causes, the Thai police said on Monday.

Warne's family were told of the result and had accepted the finding. His body would be transferred to Australian consular officials for return to the family, a deputy police spokesman said.

"Today investigators received the autopsy result, in which the medical opinion is that the cause of death is natural," Kissana Phathanacharoen said in a statement.

"Investigators will summarize the autopsy result for prosecutors within the timeframe of the law."

Well-wishers left tributes of flowers, flags, an Australian sports shirt, a can of beans and a packet of cigarettes outside the villa on the northeast coast of Koh Samui where Warne was found unconscious.

Warne, 52, one of the finest spin bowlers of all time, whose talent and personality transcended the sport, died on Friday, spurring tributes, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling him "one of our nation's greatest characters"

Tom Hall, who was staying at the same resort where Warne was found unconscious in his room, said there were "no unusual circumstances" surrounding the flamboyant former cricketer's death.

Hall, chief executive of website the Sporting News, said none of Warne's travelling companions were aware of him visiting a doctor, though he had complained to a friend of "some chest pains and shortness of breath".

Earlier, Thai police said Warne also had asthma and some heart issues, citing information from his family. read more

Australian media said Warne's family funeral would be followed by a memorial service at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) within two or three weeks.

The Great Southern Stand at the MCG, where the spinner took his 700th wicket on Boxing Day 2006, will be renamed the S K Warne Stand.(Reuters)

While raising concerns regarding the continued lack of progress on accountability and regret that there have been setbacks in several emblematic human rights cases, the United Kingdom called on the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 and to co-operate with your Office.

The UK's Global Ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French delivering her statement during the Interactive Dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka, said they welcomed recent releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah as a positive first step. Whilst we acknowledge initial reforms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, these do not go far enough.

"Madam High Commissioner, The United Kingdom welcomes your update. We share your concerns regarding the continued lack of progress on accountability and regret that there have been setbacks in several emblematic human rights cases.

We welcome recent releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah as a positive first step. Whilst we acknowledge initial reforms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, these do not go far enough.

Whilst we acknowledge the NGO Secretariat move to the Foreign Ministry, we have concerns around surveillance and harassment of civil society, and militarisation of civilian governmental functions. The appointment of an individual, named in a key emblematic case, to the post of Provincial Governor, is particularly worrying.

Whilst we acknowledge ongoing work in Government institutions on reparations and missing persons, it is crucial this is accompanied by a comprehensive reconciliation and accountability process.

We note with concern that minority communities are facing increased marginalisation, with allegations of land grabs in the North and East of the country.

We call on the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 and to co-operate with your Office," she said.

## [10:23] Brent crude nears $140 per barrel, headed towards all-time high

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Brent-crude-nears-140-per-barrel-headed-towards-all-time-high/108-232502](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Brent-crude-nears-140-per-barrel-headed-towards-all-time-high/108-232502)

Brent oil prices soared to a near 14-year high of $140 on Sunday as traders fretted over the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery reached $139.13 shortly after electronic trading opened around 2300 GMT, heading towards a 2008 record high before retreating slightly over the next hour.

The European benchmark crude hit its record price of $147.50 per barrel in July 2008.

By 0030 GMT, Brent crude had dropped a little more to $128.77 per barrel — 9.02 percent higher than its closing price on Friday.

The price per barrel of Brent oil has increased 33 percent since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

New York’s benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil also soared Sunday to $130.50 per barrel for April delivery. It, too, then dropped slightly over the next hour and a half.

By 0030 GMT, WTI crude was at $125.15 per barrel, an 8.18 percent increase from its closing price on Friday.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington was in “active discussions” with European nations about banning Russian oil imports as further economic penalty against Moscow, although he stopped short of announcing an outright boycott.

Even if oil is technically still exempt from sanctions, Russian oil exporters are struggling to find buyers. Shell is one of the only companies still buying Russian oil, although it said it would donate the profits to Ukrainian causes.

Asked Sunday on CNN about Shell’s announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Shell and other energy giants to cut off Moscow’s biggest revenue source and “stop buying Russian oil.”

“Russian oil and gas smells of Ukrainian blood,” he said.(AFP)

## [10:05] Denara to kick off  first training programmes for young enterprising women

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Denara-to-kick-off-first-training-programmes-for-young-enterprising-women/108-232515](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Denara-to-kick-off-first-training-programmes-for-young-enterprising-women/108-232515)

Denara Training Institute will kick-start their mission and vision while planning to inaugurate their first training programmes for young enterprising women, which coincides with the celebration of International Women's Day.

Denara Training Institute was established in October 2021 with a vision of training young women of all communities living in Sri Lanka in technical and social skills. Why Denara? Because, the name is of Persian origin which refers to "children of heaven and earth.”

Denara is a not for profit organisation, but has to be financially sustainable and hence will charge a nominal fee for the courses they plan to offer. Centrally located in Colombo 5, the establishment of Denara Training Institute is meant to empower women to be independent and take charge of their adult life. It is proposed to have a two part programme to impart employable skills and social skills needed to transition the student to an independent adult life. Speaking to Fathima Aziz, Director, Denara Training Institute, this is what she had to say: "We are looking forward to launching our training programmes for young enterprising women."

The Management proposes to establish English Language Training courses, including Spoken English, Speech and Drama. There will also be courses in Presentation Skills, Conflict Resolution and Negotiation Skills suitable for the current job market. Life skills workshops would include understanding their rights, financial independence, balancing family life and maintaining emotional and overall health. Trained students can subsequently join Denara as a teacher, trainer or counsellor on a paid or voluntary basis as required. It is also proposed to establish a Computer Lab offering IT Skills Training Courses in the near future.

To kick-start their mission and vision, they plan to inaugurate their first programme which coincides with the celebration of International Women's Day. The Denara Training Institute has organized a Cookery Demonstration in association with Singer Sri Lanka (PLC) featuring Ms. Jovanka Jayaweera of Big Bird Delights on Saturday 12th March from 3 to 6 pm at their premises in Mangala Gardens, Colombo 5. She will prepare a variety of popular items using Singer Home Appliances and demonstrate innovative ways to prepare delectable dishes.

The country is currently facing a severe gas shortage as three gas tankers are being anchored off the Sri Lankan waters due to the non-issuance of letters of credit by Sri Lankan commercial banks in the face of the dollar crisis.

Informed sources said that since last Friday distribution of Litro gas has come to a complete halt. Our reporters confirmed that people from most of the areas in the country are complaining about the gas shortage in their respective areas.

Due to the shortage, operations of crematoriums, factories and large scale hotels, bakeries have been severely affected. “Some 1000 bakeries have already halted their operations temporarily due to the lack of gas,” a spokesman for the All Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association said.

Several attempts to contact Litro Gas Company officials have failed.

Meanwhile, informed sources revealed that three gas tankers have been anchored in Sri Lankan waters for the past six days due to the non-issuance of letters of credit by Sri Lankan commercial banks.

Meanwhile, several public protests were held in some areas in the country during the past few days over the gas shortage. (Sunil Jayasiri)

## [09:29] SLPP edges closer to form new govt; MR urgently calls for political calm

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/SLPP-edges-closer-to-form-new-govt-MR-urgently-calls-for-political-calm/342-232490](https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/SLPP-edges-closer-to-form-new-govt-MR-urgently-calls-for-political-calm/342-232490)

In addition to the economic, fuel, power and food crisis which has severely hampered the daily lives of all citizens in the country, Sri Lanka has now been plunged into severe political turmoil after two cabinet ministers were sacked last week and 11 dissident members are now threatening to leave the government.

The sacking of Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa has caused a huge stir within the political ranks with the 11 dissidents which also include former president Maithripala Sirisena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara likely to sit as independent MPs in the next parliamentary session.

President Rajapaksa has shown no indication to take back the sacked duo and has also made it clear that those unable to work with the present government and working against it, will have no place in this government.

He has also not held any discussions with the 11 dissidents, and moves are now underway to see if a complete SLPP government can be formed to restart the stalled work.

However, the man who has now stepped in to calm the situation is Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Following the sacking of Wimal and Udaya last Thursday, Mahinda had called the 11 members and informed them to come to meet him at Temple Trees on Friday in order to leave aside political differences as this was not the time to stir another crisis.

However, despite waiting for all 11 members for several hours on Friday, none of the dissidents showed up and for the first time in Mahinda's political career, he had been stood up.

The Daily Mirror learns that some senior members close to Mahinda had on Friday night asked some of the 11 dissidents as to why they failed to attend the discussions with the Prime Minister to which they had alleged that they had been forced not to attend by Udaya.

This was then conveyed to Mahinda. Mahinda has since then commented that the ongoing economic and fuel crises should be sorted first and relief must be given to the people. He had even mentioned to senior SLPP members that the time was not right for politicians to work on hidden agendas and solutions must be sought to give immediate relief to the citizens.

Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara who is also part of the dissident group, had late on Friday night said he will meet Mahinda on Monday and see if issues can be sorted even if others fail to attend.

However, sacked Minister Udaya Gammanpila had a different story to tell. Udaya told Daily Mirror last evening that Mahinda had not extended any invitation to meet him or Wimal and this was a rumour spread by people with vested interests. He said that following their sacking, Mahinda had called him and Wimal and sympathized with them but had not extended any invitation for any discussions. He said no one else from the SLPP had also contacted them.

Meanwhile senior government sources said that Mahinda had in a public rally held over the weekend hinted that the fuel shortage had been caused artificially and some groups were behind it. He had also said there was improper communication over the fuel crisis and added that in the past Sri Lanka had faced worst scenarios but had been able to get out of it. Political sources within the SLPP said that if Udaya meets Mahinda in any future discussion, he will have to face these questions by the Prime Minister. It is also learnt that while Mahinda is trying to call for political stability, he had also summoned the PUCSL Chairman last week to Temple Trees and sternly told him to stop releasing contradictory statements to the public which was leading to further public anger. It is learnt that the Prime Minister had told the Chairman that this was not the time for the PUCSL to lose its credibility.

In closed-door discussions held by government members last week, it is also learnt that some senior SLPP members had commented saying it was good that the "trouble makers" had been sacked as although Sri Lanka did face a forex issue, the fuel issue could have been sorted out as countries such as the UAE had agreed to supply fuel on a credit line. However the government had failed to act.

Senior ministers had also commented that the time was now right to form a SLPP government, something which has been backed by Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and an option that the President is now considering.

However, despite the efforts of the government or even the Prime Minister to desperately calm the situation, the public are far from convinced that the government including Mahinda will sort the existing crises.

Public anger has spread so much that protests are now breaking out in several areas of the country, with people lining up on the streets every night, asking politicians to stop playing with people's lives. The protests, which have no political backing by any groups, is organized solely by citizens who have expressed disgust at all political parties, especially the government and are urging for normalcy in their daily lives. The protests will continue this week as well and are soon spreading to other districts, increasing the heat on the government. (JAMILA HUSAIN)

## [09:11] Nadungamuwa Raja dies

Nadungamuwa Vijaya Raja, popularly known as Nadungamuwa Raja passed away this morning, the caretaker of the elephant Harsha Dharmawijeya said.

He said the elephant died at 5.30 am today following a brief illness.

"The majestic animal did not have previous illness, but it did not take any food during yesterday and breathed for the last time," he said.

The elephant's death was informed to the wildlife department, since the elephant was a property of the government, Dharmawijeya said.

The burial date will be announced after inspection by wildlife officials, the caretaker said.

Nadungamuwa Raja was 65 years old when died, was a celebrated pachyderm with a towering 10.5 feet (3.2 metres) in height and was the tallest tamed tusker in the country which had its own armed guards. Raja walks 90 km (55 miles) to the hill resort of Kandy for the event, called the Esala pageant.

He walks 25 to 30 km a day, travelling mostly at night when the weather is cooler.

Nadungamuwa Raja is an Indian tusker born in 1953 in Mysore, was the main casket bearer of the procession of Esala held in Kandy until recently and was one of the two elephant calves gifted by a Mysuru Maharaja to the veteran native physician monk who was living in Nilammahara Temple Piliyandala in appreciation of curing his relative's long lasted illness, other elephant being Nawam Raja of Gangaramaya that too not among the living.

## [08:05] CB continues to resist  IMF-led debt restructuring to end foreign exchange crisis

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/business__main/CB-continues-to-resist-IMF-led-debt-restructuring-to-end-foreign-exchange-crisis/245-232470](https://www.dailymirror.lk/business__main/CB-continues-to-resist-IMF-led-debt-restructuring-to-end-foreign-exchange-crisis/245-232470)

CB Governor says Road Map presented last Oct. has borne fruits and SL has no need of an IMF programme

Says SL doesn’t have a problem in its foreign currency inflows, but a significant increase in outflows

Says no request made to China to restructure Yuan denominated debt

Believes current exchange rate suitable given the ramifications should the rupee was devalued



The Central Bank is still disinclined to recommend to the government to seek  International Monetary Fund (IMF) support for a rescue package and foreign currency debt restructuring even amid the country in a deeper foreign exchange crisis, which has resulted in unending fuel shortages and power cuts.



However, the Central Bank raised policy interest rates by 100 basis points on Friday, delivering the highest rate hike in more than a dozen years and proposed a number of policy adjustments, which more or less mirrored the policy cures IMF prescribed for Sri Lanka in the same week after the conclusion of the Article IV consolations, to help overcome the current crisis. However, their implementation is contingent on the government’s willingness.

Except for the proposal for discouraging non-essential and non-urgent imports, everything else must be implemented to avert further economic calamity, complemented by gradual floating of the currency, according to economic analysts.



Speaking at a post-monetary policy presser held on Friday, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said they remain on course of the Road Map presented in October despite certain delays, and hence the country doesn’t need to seek IMF support or restructure debt under an IMF-backed programme.



According to Cabraal, Sri Lanka doesn’t have a problem in its foreign currency inflows, but a significant increase in outflows, which has resulted in the current predicament in the foreign exchange market.



Merchandise imports to Sri Lanka reached just under US$ 22 billion last year, hitting the highest in three years despite the languishing economy.



However, with or without the IMF, Sri Lanka will have to resolve its foreign exchange crisis soon to avert life and business-crippling fuel shortages and power cuts.



Getting the forex crisis behind them soon is also in the best interest of the government as the crisis has already made cracks in the coalition government with eleven connected parties threatening to pull out.



Meanwhile, in response to a question on the progress of the request made to China for Yuan denominated debt restructuring, Cabraal denied making such a request.



While the Monetary Board had paid attention to make some changes to the exchange rate, Cabraal said the Board deemed the current exchange rate is suitable given the ramifications should the rupee was devalued.

Attygalle and Director General/External Resources Department Ajith Abeysekera















JKH Chairman Krishan Balendra and IFC Regional Vice President for Asia and the Pacific Alfonso Garcia Mora













A top IFC official says the development organisation aims to boost its investments in Sri Lanka, with a focus on supporting private sector job creation, paving the way for robust investments to help spur the country’s recovery and future growth.

The comments by IFC Regional Vice President for Asia and the Pacific Alfonso Garcia Mora, came at the end of a three-day visit to Sri Lanka, which included a meeting with the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, government officials, including the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, private sector representatives, entrepreneurs, and development partners.

Garcia Mora was accompanied by IFC’s Vice President for Risk Mohamed Gouled, Regional Director for South Asia Hector Gomez Ang and the new Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Lisa Kaestner, as well as the World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka, Maldives and Nepal Faris Hadad-Zervos.

“In my meeting with His Excellency the President, we discussed the need to have a sound macro fiscal stability to attract foreign capital and provide medium- and long-term certainty,” Garcia Mora said. “The talks also focused on ways to maximise the potential of the country’s private sector to help address Sri Lanka’s challenges and achieve the inclusive growth the country needs.”

“We are committed to Sri Lanka,” Garcia Mora said. “This is demonstrated by our investment commitments in the past six months which have targeted export-oriented industries. Since the onset of the pandemic, IFC has also played a strong counter cyclical role in its financing and will continue to build on that program going forward.”

During his meetings, Garcia Mora highlighted IFC's investment of $ 450 million during the first 18 months of the pandemic in Sri Lanka as a sign of IFC's steadfast commitment to the country.

“We are working with the private sector in the country to create a robust investment pipeline and this can be accelerated with additional reforms in the infrastructure sector, allowing the private sector to play a bigger role,” Garcia Mora said. “IFC intends to invest a further $ 150 million during the current fiscal year ending in June 2022. Over the next five years, IFC is looking at an investment pipeline of more than $ 800 million, specifically in supporting growth-enabling sustainable infrastructure.”

IFC’s efforts will focus around three strategic pillars in Sri Lanka: supporting innovation for growth, including export diversification, start-ups, niche market agriculture and value additions for export, high tech manufacturing; growth-enabling sustainable infrastructure, including low-cost clean energy, sustainable transport and logistics systems; and deepening social and financial inclusion, including digitisation, economic participation of underserved people, especially women.

While in Colombo, Garcia Mora also signed a cooperation agreement with John Keells Holdings (JKH) to develop a commercially viable and sustainable street market in Colombo 2, which will also promote women’s participation in hospitality and tourism. The officials also had the opportunity to meet clients and partners of Women in Work program – IFC’s largest, standalone country-based gender program designed to close gender gaps in Sri Lanka’s private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, IFC has invested $ 450 million in Sri Lanka, including $ 175 million in JKH to boost retail and tourism – IFC’s largest investment in Sri Lanka over its 50-year operations. As part of the overall pandemic response, IFC injected $ 50 million in Commercial Bank of Ceylon and $ 25 million in Nations Trust Bank to help small businesses stay afloat during the height of the pandemic.

IFC’s strategy also focused on expanding export diversification, promoting sustainability and inclusive growth. Last year, IFC piloted a new digital health program – DigiHealth – to boost access to affordable and quality health-care services in Sri Lanka and beyond.

In October, IFC also issued its first-ever rupee-denominated bond in the country – the ‘Serendib Bond’ – to ensure that the private-sector has access to long-term offshore financing in local currency.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet





United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday, introducing the report on Sri Lanka, said the Government should take further steps to address the fundamental problems with the Prevention of Terrorism Act and undertake deeper legal, institutional and security sector reforms that were critically needed to put an end to impunity and prevent any reoccurrence of past violations. Victims and their families continued to be denied truth and justice.

“There was deep concern about the concentration of civilian positions in the hands of military officials, some of them implicated in serious allegations of human rights violations.  The Council should pursue alternative strategies to advance accountability at the international level,” she said.

Sri Lanka, speaking as the country concerned, said the resolution was directly contrary to the Council’s founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.  There were serious anomalies and problems with the report.  It had an intolerably intrusive character and there was a clear element of discrimination within it. This in itself struck at the root of the foundations of the United Nations system.

It was deeply regretted that numerous unsubstantiated allegations had found their way into the report.  The international community should join Sri Lanka on a footing of mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.

In the ensuing debate, speakers said Sri Lanka should ensure a safe democratic space, and strong independent judicial institutions.  The erosion of democratic institutions and the lack of accountability for past human rights violations undermined progress.  The Government had taken the first steps to undertake reforms but there was a long road ahead.

More comprehensive reforms were needed to allow civil society to operate freely and safely and to bring terrorism legislation in line with international norms and standards.  Ensuring accountability and justice for survivors was essential for maintaining peace and ensuring reconciliation.

Some speakers said that reports should be based on reliable, objective and neutral observation.  The development of reports should be done with constructive cooperation with the concerned country.  When dealing with human rights situations, the Council should retain a non-biased, non-selective and non-hypocritical point of view.

Speaking this afternoon on the situation in Eritrea were the European Union, Iceland on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Philippines, France, Djibouti, Luxembourg, Venezuela, China, Cuba, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Russian Federation, Benin, Australia, Sudan, Ireland, Belarus, United States, Belgium, United Kingdom, Canada, Somalia, Syria, Iran and South Sudan.

Also speaking were the following non-governmental organisations: Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Eastern Horn of Africa: Human Rights Defenders Project, Civicus World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Amnesty International, Advocates for Human Rights, and UN Watch.

Speaking on Sri Lanka were the European Union, Netherlands on behalf of the Benelux countries, Norway on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, United Kingdom on behalf of the Sri Lanka Core Group, Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Germany, Egypt, Montenegro, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Canada, Philippines, Nepal, Kenya, India and France.

Speakers said Sri Lanka should ensure a safe democratic space and strong independent judicial institutions.  The erosion of democratic institutions and the lack of accountability for past human rights violations was undermining progress. The building of a prosperous State for all Sri Lankans was required, including all minorities.

The Government had taken the first steps to undertake reforms, but there was a long road ahead.  There was also concern for political prisoners still in custody, and concern that the proposed changes were not sufficient to address human rights concerns.  There should be freedom of speech for journalists and those in minority communities, as well as non-governmental organisations.

The Government should ensure the independence and effectiveness of human rights institutions, and encourage proper investigation of reports of deaths in police custody.  There should be full implementation of Council resolution 46/1.

More comprehensive reforms were needed to allow civil society to operate freely and safely, and to bring terrorism legislation in line with international norms and standards.  The rights of religious minorities should be protected.  More inclusive governance was needed in Sri Lanka: a safe and open space should be maintained, even for dissent.  Ensuring accountability and justice for survivors was essential for maintaining peace and ensuring reconciliation.

A more comprehensive and deeper reform agenda was required to ensure that future violations could not occur.  The Government should fully consider the numerous and consecutive recommendations made by various United Nations mechanisms and organisations.  The lack of domestic progress in accountability and the reconciliation process required further commitment by the Government.  The human rights situation could degrade further if steps were not taken to address the issues of the past.

Some speakers said that reports should be based on reliable, objective and neutral observation.  The development of reports should be done with constructive cooperation with the concerned country.  When dealing with human rights situations, the Council should retain a non-biased, non-selective and non-hypocritical point of view.

The community of nations should support in good faith any steps taken towards reconciliation in the country, and encourage genuine dialogue in an impartial manner, standing against selectivity, politicisation and double standards.  The Human Rights Council should support Sri Lanka in order to achieve its priorities for its domestic development in the context of its own needs.

## [02:17] Core Group notes Sri Lanka’s progress in addressing key reforms limited

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Core-Group-notes-Sri-Lanka-s-progress-in-addressing-key-reforms-limited/56-731595](https://www.ft.lk/news/Core-Group-notes-Sri-Lanka-s-progress-in-addressing-key-reforms-limited/56-731595)

The Core Group on Sri Lanka while acknowledging first steps by Sri Lanka to address key reforms, noted that progress since Council resolution 46/1 is limited.

Issuing a statement on Friday at the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council, the Sri Lanka Core Group comprising Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi, Montenegro, the United Kingdom and the United States said, in particular, slow progress by the Office of Missing Persons in fully investigating cases since the release of the preliminary list of missing persons is troubling.

“Our concerns over surveillance and intimidation of civil society persist and detentions, threats and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders continue. It is crucial that civic space remains open.”

The Core Group welcomed the releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah, but said the proposed changes to the PTA are very limited and our longstanding concerns remain.

“The Core Group on Sri Lanka today while recognising the challenges the island nation is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to express concern about current human rights developments in Sri Lanka and stressed the importance of a comprehensive reconciliation and accountability process.”

The Core Group noted that new ‘One Country One Law’ taskforce risks undermining Sri Lanka’s pluralist society and urged Sri Lanka to ensure that this taskforce’s work is inclusive and non-discriminatory.

“We call for full cooperation with the High Commissioner and remain ready to support the Government on the implementation of resolution 46/1,” the Core Group said.

## [02:14] Sri Lanka exposes UNHRC’s double standards and discrimination

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-exposes-UNHRC-s-double-standards-and-discrimination/56-731594](https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-exposes-UNHRC-s-double-standards-and-discrimination/56-731594)

Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris delivers Sri Lanka’s statement at interactive dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka at the 49th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday















Sri Lanka on Friday alleged double standards and discrimination on the part of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) whilst it expressed concerns over numerous instances of unsubstantiated allegations on the part of the latter.

This view was expressed by Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris in his statement during the interactive dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka at the 49th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Following is the full statement by Sri Lanka.

The Resolution 46/1 on Sri Lanka was adopted by a divided vote in this Council. Sri Lanka and other Member States opposed this resolution in fundamental disagreement with its deeply flawed procedure and unacceptable content, in particular its OP para 6 regarding a so-called evidence-gathering mechanism. The Resolution was directly contrary to the Council’s founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. It went well beyond the mandate that Member States conferred on it by UNGA Resolution 60/251. I have stated Sri Lanka’s views on this matter to this Council on 1 March. We also submitted in a timely manner our comments on the High Commissioner’s report. We note with regret that the Secretariat failed to publish this simultaneously with the High Commissioner’s written update.

Despite our rejection of the resolution, we will continue our voluntary international undertakings on human rights and engage with the United Nations, including with this Council. As stated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka to our Parliament on 18 January 2022, “We are a nation that respects international laws and conventions”. We have regularly shared our progress and challenges in a candid and open exchange with this Council and other relevant organs of the United Nations system.

We are convinced that there are serious anomalies and weaknesses in the report presented to this Council by the High Commissioner. The fundamental deficiency is its intolerably intrusive character, impinging as it does on core functions and responsibilities of organs of the Sri Lankan State, overwhelmingly mandated by the people of our country at three successive elections.

There is, as well, a clearly discernible element of discrimination, in that the Council would certainly not take it upon itself to embark on a similar inquisitorial procedure in respect of other Member States. This, in itself, strikes at the very root of the foundations of the United Nations system. The issue of uniformity and consistency of standards applied by the High Commissioner to Member States, irrespective of their size and influence, and in steadfast conformity with the essential principle relating to the sovereign equality of all members of the United Nations fraternity, is cynically transgressed in several portions of this report.

To our minds, this is particularly disturbing because the strength and prestige of the United Nations, and especially the Human Rights Council, derive from the widespread regard of the international community, as a whole, for the moral and ethical basis underpinning the attitudes of the Council. We fervently believe that it is vitally important to retain this confidence undiminished, especially having regard to the fate of the Human Rights Commission, the predecessor of this Council. It is a matter for deep regret that numerous instances of unsubstantiated allegations and superficial conclusions insensitive to the complexity of ground situations have found their way into the report. We have commented on these in extensive detail in our written response.

We are dismayed by the High Commissioner’s unwarranted onslaught on seminal institutions of our country which function under the aegis of Sri Lanka’s Constitution and legal system, emanating from a rich and varied cultural heritage, and are subject to stringent review processes which form an integral part of our tried and tested laws.

There is also the question of use of stringently limited resources in such a manner as to achieve optimal benefit for all of humanity at a time of unprecedented crisis. The colossal expenditure of millions of dollars in a partisan and specifically targeted pursuit of Sri Lanka is hardly consonant with this obvious imperative. It seems to us a great pity that the report shows scant regard for these considerations which appear to a wide swath of nations to be crucially important at this time.

The Government of Sri Lanka is firmly resolved to maintain the security and stability that we have restored for our people and ensure sustainable progress in an equitable manner. My country reaches out to the international community with the sincere exhortation to join us as partners on a footing of equality and mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.

## [00:03] Inequality and fallacies in the law - EDITORIAL

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Inequality-and-fallacies-in-the-law-EDITORIAL/231-232445](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Inequality-and-fallacies-in-the-law-EDITORIAL/231-232445)

‘Equality before law means, that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike. Sadly this description is not always followed in international politics or even in domestic and day-to-day affairs.

The Palestinians as a group are among the biggest victims of inequality. Palestine, or what little was left of it after that country was divided, has been subject to numerous invasions by the government of the state of Israel. Yet the UN has not condemned Israel for its invasion of a sovereign member state.

A UN report of March 26, 2009 found Israel guilty of using white phosphorus munitions in the air over populated areas in Palestine, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital between December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009.



Israel has as yet not been charged before the ICC for War Crimes or, Crimes against Humanity. Whereas today the ICC is investigating as to whether Russia could be charged with committing War Crimes and/or Crimes Against Humanity for invading Ukraine!!!.

Palestinians who have taken up arms to combat Israeli occupation are accused of terrorism, while in Ukraine civillians taking up arms against invading Russian troops are praised as heroes and patriots.



In India, one of the most distinctive forms of social inequity come within the spheres of gender and caste, where, people coming from the marginalized sections are directly impacted in terms of opportunities, access to essential utilities, and their treatment by the very forces supposed to uphold the law

In our own country too, we see numerous instances of inequality before the law. For instance way back in 1962 members of the armed forces attempted a coup-de-tat. All were found guilty in local courts of law. They were sentenced to serve terms of imprisonment.



Those who took part in the coup, were held at the magazine prison and released on appeal to by Britain’s Privy Council on a technicality. Even though they were found to be guilty of attempting to overthrow the elected government of the country, all the coup members from wealthy backgrounds, subsequently served at the highest levels of government departments after a change in government.

By comparison, many of the insurgents of the JVP uprising of 1971 were held in limestone islands off the coast of Trincomalee. Many captives claimed they had little or no clothing during their incarceration.



Fast forward to 2015, a time when presidential elections were held two years before time in January 2015. In the run-up to the election, the then opposition alleged the president and his family had robbed the country of millions of dollars. They promised the electorate to bring the culprits to book and promised a clean government if elected to power.

At the polls, the then President - Mahinda Rajapaksa - under whose mandate the 30-year war against terrorism was successfully brought to an end was defeated.  A new president took power. Though the new government for the course of its tenure continually made reference to frauds committed by the ex-president, no charges were ever framed against him.  Meanwhile, within a month the new government’s installation, the opposition under Mahinda Rajapaksa were hinting at a huge fraud at the country’s Central Bank - a bond scam.

The bond scandal was a financial laundering scam which took place in February 2015. It caused huge losses of more than US$ 11 million to the country and is regarded as the largest reported financial scam in the country.



It proved to be a major blow to the newly-elected government led by ex-president Maithripala Sirisena and his Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The new regime attempted to cover up the scam and dragged its feet on charging ex- government leaders of corruption. Only a few public servants were harassed.

Weakened by the scandal and rifts between the president and his premier. The government was rightfully drubbed at the presidential election of 2019, which saw former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s brother - Gotabaya Rajapaksa - elected President.



The new government charged a number of individuals including the ex-Finance Minister, the then Central Bank Governor, the heads of a few private companies and a few others. An Interpol red notice was issued on the ex-Governor of the Central Bank who fled the country. He was tried in absentia. On March 4 this year, the accused were cleared.   The public is beginning to believe politicians are playing a game of ‘you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.’

The fallout - where the people beginning to lose faith in the system of justice itself.

## [00:02] Repealing PTA

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/plus/Repealing-PTA/352-232444](https://www.dailymirror.lk/plus/Repealing-PTA/352-232444)

People are seen placing their signatures during a campaign to abolish the proposed PTA



I often reflect on the tumultuous years of the late 1970s and the paths not taken that may have determined a different future for our country. Emergency rule and then the enactment of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in 1979 are unforgettable times of my childhood in Jaffna. It was perhaps the excitement of the solidarity visit of many progressives from the South including the visionary Jesuit Socialist Rev. Fr. Paul Casperz as repression mounted along with the PTA, and the formation of the Jaffna branch of the Movement for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE) of which my father became the founding chair. The disquiet memories as a school boy, eaves dropping on the horrifying stories of abductions, detentions and torture, which were being documented by my father and his fellow human rights activists, left in me a long antipathy towards the PTA and more broadly state repression.



As I grew up and in conversations with my father, I often wondered what our past would have been if the JR Jayawardena regime of that era had not chosen the path of repression in the face of rising militancy of Tamil youth. Would our history been different and could we have avoided the civil war if our political leaders had addressed the problems politically and changed the social consciousness in our country? In any event, the reprehensible use of emergency powers and the PTA through the long protracted war led to the hope that the PTA will be repealed after the war. However, that was not to be as the Rajapaksa regime decided on greater militarization and securitization in the post-war years.





"Our laws and for that matter the legal grounding of our modern state  have always been influenced by international developments from the times  of colonial rule to copying the PTA after it was enacted by the British in 1974 to address the problems in Northern Ireland"





This is my entry point into the current campaign launched by parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran to repeal the PTA. It is refreshing to see political actors, religious leaders and most importantly the people from different quarters of the country signing onto this campaign. And as this important campaign gains momentum, I address below some of the challenges of not just repealing the PTA from the law books but also purging from our social consciousness the dangerous ideas of the expediency and efficacy of anti-terror laws.

International outlook

Our laws and for that matter the legal grounding of our modern state have always been influenced by international developments from the times of colonial rule to copying the PTA after it was enacted by the British in 1974 to address the problems in Northern Ireland. Then two decades ago, the US-led “war on terror” after the attacks of September 11, 2001 proliferated anti-terror laws all around the world, and even pushed for resolutions in the UN legitimizing such repressive

legal regimes.



This historical context is important, because the current campaign to repeal the PTA is linked to the international pressure by the European Union and the UNHRC to reform the PTA. However, given the ubiquity of anti-terror laws in our age, these international actors are unlikely and lack the legitimacy to call for a complete repeal of the PTA. My point is that while international pressures and influence are part of our political realities, the campaign to repeal the PTA has to be on a solid domestic footing to achieve its goal.

In this context, an important recent assertion, both the report by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bachelet and a joint statement by a number of UN Special Rapporteurs, calls for an immediate moratorium on the use of the PTA in Sri Lanka and the release of all those unjustly detained under this abusive law. Such a suspension of the PTA is a starting point, but it should not just lead to the reform of the PTA, rather its complete repeal given the history of our experience with the workings of such extraordinary laws.

Social consciousness



The history of modern states has been one of using martial laws, emergency powers, anti-terror laws and for that matter criminal laws, to both bring about order in society and towards unjust political ends. In other words, liberal democracies are fragile and the structure of their development itself has been constituted by both the “rule of law” and its exceptions providing for tremendous abuse of power.



The critical legal scholar Nasser Hussain in his book, ‘The Jurisprudence of Emergency: Colonialism and the Rule of Law’ has pointed out the troubling character of liberal order, where law, violence and order are constituted in the making of our modern states. He draws on political theorist Partha Chatterjee’s idea of the “rule of colonial difference” to articulate how martial laws and for that matter emergency laws are entrenched into the liberal order through social and political discourses and processes of “othering”. In the case of Sri Lanka, this legacy is all the more apparent when we consider the fact that emergency rule and the PTA have both been in force for more than half the period of our postcolonial history; including through the “othering” of minorities. Furthermore, those in power justify such anti-terror laws not just during times of armed conflict, but also as needed for our future security from a variety of threats. Indeed, those struggling for political changes and those opposed to dispossessing development policies can also be targeted.





"In the case of Sri Lanka, this legacy is all the more apparent when we consider the fact that emergency rule and the PTA have both been in force for more than half the period of our postcolonial history"





The point I want to draw from such theorisation is that the abuse of state power are not limited to the enactment of exceptional laws, and the containment of such state power cannot be through legal changes alone. The debates and struggles to address the abuse of state power and the social consciousness that emerges in opposing such state power – including draconian laws – are even more important. I have heard from Indian intellectuals that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s attempt in the 1970s to undermine electoral democracy through a state of emergency led to such tremendous societal opposition that it is unlikely any regime in the future will attempt such a strategy of using emergency rule to continue in power. Similarly, despite all the shortcomings of our political culture, I believe the reason that our people never fell for a military coup and consistently changed powerful regimes considered to be invincible, is a reflection of the democratic ethos deeply etched into our social consciousness.



The call of the hour is for intellectuals to join the people and take up the ideological struggle against anti-terror laws. While we must struggle for the repeal of the PTA, we must also work to purge the possibility of the return of anti-terror laws from our national political consciousness. The people’s rejection of the PTA should be overwhelmingly clear to the current and future regimes in power.

## [00:01] SVB spearheads an island-wide support system to eliminate violence against women - Hirunika Premachandra

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/hard-talk/SVB-spearheads-an-island-wide-support-system-to-eliminate-violence-against-women-Hirunika-Premachandra/334-232443](https://www.dailymirror.lk/hard-talk/SVB-spearheads-an-island-wide-support-system-to-eliminate-violence-against-women-Hirunika-Premachandra/334-232443)

"Stemming from this campaign, we have been proactively taking the issue of eliminating violence against women to our grassroots level members in the periphery. There is now a consciousness on this topic among women at grassroots level and they are encouraged to speak out and seek redress when victimized"





The Samagi Vanitha Balawegaya (SVB), the women’s wing of Samagi Jana Balawegaya has spearheaded several initiatives to address issues faced by women and children at grassroots level. The Sakwala programme for instance, aims to empower students and teachers from underprivileged schools with modern technology. In view of International Women’s Day, SVB’s National Organizer Hirunika Premachandra spoke about initiatives taken by SJB women politicians to address issues of violence and harassment faced by women, interventions by SVB at grassroots level to promote gender equality.

The Excerpts:

Q   Incidents of child abuse and violence against women have escalated over the past few months. What are the interventions that have been taken by women politicians in this regard?

It has been proven that incidents of abuse among women and children have increased with the lockdown and work at home practices with the new normal. I cannot speak about women politicians in general in Sri Lanka. I will speak of women politicians at local and national level in the SJB- the largest opposition party in Sri Lanka.

Our leader, Sajith Premadasa is extremely gender sensitive and deeply committed towards gender equality. SJB women’s wing, the Samagi Vanitha Balawegaya, adopts a “bottom up” approach in addressing gender based violence and violence against children. Our women leaders at grassroots level who function through our network of branches island wide collaborate with local and national level women politicians. They are aware of cases of violence and provide safe space and assistance to victims to seek redress. They bring these cases to the attention of counsellors, health care workers and lawyers from the SJB lawyers association as needed. We have lawyers attached to all the district courts in Sri Lanka. They provide legal assistance as required.

Q   Why don’t we see the elected women politicians talking about these matters in Parliament?

Unfortunately, the percentage of women politicians in the national parliament is very low. Hence the time allocated to women politicians in the parliamentary proceedings is limited.

When I was a member of parliament, I used the limited time available and was very vocal in bringing up in parliament, issues relating to women. For example, I proposed that every school should have a qualified counsellor or even a teacher should be trained to provide professional counselling to students in need of counselling. I am happy to record that this recommendation was accepted and implemented by the Ministry of Education. I also took up the issue of harassment of women using public transport and also on the road. I advocated that a special desk should be established in each police station to cater exclusively to women who are subject to such harassment. I also proposed that laws should be brought in to take action against media channels and publications that disseminate media messages that insults and degrades women.

SJB women parliamentary representatives, Thalatha Athukorale and Rohini Kaviratne speak on behalf of women as often as possible. SJB which is a new political party, has undertaken to provide 25% quota of nominations to women for the forthcoming local and provincial council election. We expect greater focus on women’s issue when the percentage of women in local and national political platforms increases.





"Our leader, Sajith Premadasa is extremely gender sensitive and deeply committed towards gender equality. SJB women’s wing, the Samagi Vanitha Balawegaya, adopts a “bottom up” approach in addressing gender based violence and violence against children"





Q   What are the initiatives taken by SVB to address these matters at the grassroots level?

Demonstrating its commitment to uplifting the status of women in Sri Lanka, SJB made history as a political party by implementing an intensive programme for 16 days on the occasion of the international day for the elimination of violence against women, starting from November 25, 2021.

The programme was spearheaded by SVB under the theme “Orange the World: End violence against Women”. Women from all walks of life participated actively in this memorable programme. Highlights were, a media briefing, island - wide protests and demonstrations, street dramas focusing on various aspects of violence, different women’s stakeholder groups visiting the party office each day and raising awareness on this theme and disseminating daily tri-lingual social messages reinforcing the theme. SJB pledged its commitment to end violence against women by illuminating the facade of the party headquarters with orange hued lights since orange was the colour used for the global campaign.

Stemming from this campaign, we have been proactively taking the issue of eliminating violence against women to our grassroots level members in the periphery. There is now a consciousness on this topic among women at grassroots level and they are encouraged to speak out and seek redress when victimized.

Q   Could you share some success stories as a result of these initiatives?

We do not bring these cases to the public arena and work on a low-key maintaining anonymity of the victims and confidentiality. However, what I can say is that in general, our support system is available island-wide and more and more women are reaching out to us. Our volunteers and legal team are quietly playing a huge role in this context.





"For men in society, I must say that we are happy that there are many progressive men who are strong advocates of equality in Sri Lanka today. But for those men who do not respect this noble principle and resort to violence against women, remember your own mother, wife, daughter and sister"





Q   Every year, during Women’s day celebrations, there are programmes and initiatives taken by various civil society organizations and even at political level. But they don’t sustain for long. How will you ensure sustainability in these initiatives?

As SJB is a new party, we celebrated UN women’s day for the first time last year. We organized an island wide art competition on the theme “End period poverty”. There was overwhelming response to this event and discourse on this important topic was generated. As our structure has been consolidated and our reach expanded significantly after this land mark event, the discourse on the need to end period poverty continues at various levels, starting from the bottom. Our focus for international women’s day 2022 is connected with the SJB Sakwala programme



SJB is making a significant impact in national development. The programme Sakwala, pursues the vision of our leader, Sajith Premadasa to empower students and teachers from underprivileged schools to access information, communication technology and digital learning through ‘smart class rooms’ and IT digital learning labs. Students from Grade 6-12 are benefitting from this programme. Internet connectivity is being provided and IT teachers are being trained. Within the next 3 years we will be equipping 200 schools island-wide and creating a network of empowered students through “Sakwala Clubs”.

As such, our women’s day initiatives focus on empowering girls with education, especially IT skills and IT related facilities. SJB is deeply committed to providing equal opportunities to women and ensuring an enabling environment for women to pursue careers in IT or any other areas of their choice





"I advocated that a special desk should be established in each police station to cater exclusively to women who are subject to such harassment. I also proposed that laws should be brought in to take action against media channels and publications that disseminate media messages that insults and degrades women"





Q   Women empowerment does not happen in unsafe and insecure environments. Shouldn’t all stakeholders including the state ministry, politicians both men and women, law enforcement authorities etc, get together in this situation and work for a common objective of ending all forms of abuse against women and children?

I agree wholeheartedly with your statement. SJB believes in “consultation, compromise and consensus”- as was often reminded by late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. We need to respect one another’s differences and work together for the common good of our country. I am encouraged by the firm commitment and sensitivity of our leader, Sajith Premadasa towards gender equality. I have seen him demonstrate his commitment through action and just not mere talk. I am convinced that under his leadership, women will be able to play a catalytic role in ensuring a sustainable tomorrow for Sri Lanka.

Q   Your message to society on this Women’s Day....

My message to all Sri Lankan society, especially women, young women and girls – don’t let the glass ceiling stop you. Be strong. Be courageous. Be ambitious. Reach out for your dreams. With the right attitude, you can reach the pinnacle.

For men, I must say that we are happy that there are many progressive men who are strong advocates of equality in Sri Lanka today. But for those men who do not respect this noble principle and resort to violence against women, remember your own mother, wife, daughter and sister. Pay attention to the United Nation’s Women’s Day theme this year : “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”. Be a partner in putting this into practice to bring about a bright and sustainable tomorrow for Sri Lanka.
