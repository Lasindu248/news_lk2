The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has approved the request made by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to have rotational power shedding for over seven hours on Monday (07) despite an earlier statement saying there would be no power cuts from March 05.

The PUCSL granted permission for seven and half hours power cut (5 hours from 8am to 6pm. and 2 and half hours from 6pm. to 11pm.) for Monday for areas of E & F while three hours power cutÂ  ( 2 hours from 9am. to 5pm. and one hour from 5pm. to 9pm.) for areas of PQRSTUV and W.

However, during a meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last week, officials of the Ministries of Power and Energy said that there would be no power cuts from March 05.(DSB)
