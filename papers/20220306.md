The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has approved the request made by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to have rotational power shedding for over seven hours on Monday (07) despite an earlier statement saying there would be no power cuts from March 05.

The PUCSL granted permission for seven and half hours power cut (5 hours from 8am to 6pm. and 2 and half hours from 6pm. to 11pm.) for Monday for areas of E & F while three hours power cut  ( 2 hours from 9am. to 5pm. and one hour from 5pm. to 9pm.) for areas of PQRSTUV and W.

However, during a meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last week, officials of the Ministries of Power and Energy said that there would be no power cuts from March 05.(DSB)

## [21:42] Geneva: Prof. Peiris questions Bachelet’s actions, complains of unfair treatment

[http://island.lk/geneva-prof-peiris-questions-bachelets-actions-complains-of-unfair-treatment/]

Accusing the UN of pursuing an agenda inimical to war-winning Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris has faulted the Office of UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet for not releasing Sri Lanka’s response along with Bachelet’s report submitted to the ongoing Geneva sessions.

The following is the text of the Foreign Minister’s statement made at the interactive dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka on March 4: “The Resolution 46/1 on Sri Lanka was adopted by a divided vote in this Council. Sri Lanka and other Member States opposed this resolution in fundamental disagreement with its deeply flawed procedure and unacceptable content, in particular its OP para 6 regarding a so-called evidence-gathering mechanism.

The Resolution was directly contrary to the Council’s founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. It went well beyond the mandate that Member States conferred on it by UNGA Resolution 60/251. I have stated Sri Lanka’s views on this matter to this Council on 01 March.

We also submitted in a timely manner our comments on the High Commissioner’s report.

We note with regret that the Secretariat failed to publish this simultaneously with the High Commissioner’s written update.

Despite our rejection of the resolution, we will continue our voluntary international undertakings on human rights and engage with the United Nations, including with this Council.

As stated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka to our Parliament on 18 January 2022, “We are a nation that respects international laws and conventions”. We have regularly shared our progress and challenges, in a candid and open exchange, with this council, and other relevant organs of the United Nations system.

“We are convinced that there are serious anomalies and weaknesses in the report presented to this Council by the High Commissioner. The fundamental deficiency is its intolerably intrusive character, impinging as it does on core functions and responsibilities of organs of the Sri Lankan State, overwhelmingly mandated by the people of our country at three successive elections. There is, as well, a clearly discernible element of discrimination, in that the Council would certainly not take it upon itself to embark on a similar inquisitorial procedure in respect of other Member States. This, in itself, strikes at the very root of the foundations of the United Nations system. The issue of uniformity and consistency of standards applied by the High Commissioner to Member States, irrespective of their size and influence, and in steadfast conformity with the essential principle relating to the sovereign equality of all members of the United Nations fraternity, is cynically transgressed in several portions of this report.

“To our minds, this is particularly disturbing because the strength and prestige of the United Nations, and especially the Human Rights Council, derive from the widespread regard of the international community, as a whole, for the moral and ethical basis underpinning the attitudes of the Council. We fervently believe that it is vitally important to retain this confidence undiminished, especially having regard to the fate of the Human Rights Commission, the predecessor of this Council. It is a matter for deep regret that numerous instances of unsubstantiated allegations and superficial conclusions insensitive to the complexity of ground situations have found their way into the report. We have commented on these in extensive detail in our written response.

“We are dismayed by the High Commissioner’s unwarranted onslaught on seminal institutions of our country which function under the aegis of Sri Lanka’s Constitution and legal system, emanating from a rich and varied cultural heritage, and are subject to stringent review processes which form an integral part of our tried and tested laws.

“There is also the question of use of limited resources in such a manner as to achieve optimal benefit for all of humanity at a time of unprecedented crisis. The colossal expenditure of millions of dollars in a partisan and specifically targeted pursuit of Sri Lanka is hardly consonant with this obvious imperative. It seems to us a great pity that the report shows scant regard for these considerations which appear to a wide swath of nations to be crucially important at this time.

“The government of Sri Lanka is firmly resolved to maintain the security and stability that we have restored for our people and ensure sustainable progress in an equitable manner. My country reaches out to the international community with the sincere exhortation to join us as partners on a footing of equality and mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.”

## [21:42] Geneva sessions: India ratchets up pressure on Lanka to hold PC polls

[http://island.lk/geneva-sessions-india-ratchets-up-pressure-on-lanka-to-hold-pc-polls/]

India has again called for early Provincial Council elections in Sri Lanka, at the Geneva-based United Nations.  India’s Permanent Representative in Geneva, Ambassador Indra Mani Pande, during the interactive session on Match 4 on the OHCHR’s written report on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka declared: “We will continue to urge the Sri Lankan Government for the early conduct of elections to the Provincial Councils in keeping with its commitment to devolution of power.”

Provincial Councils were introduced in terms of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution enacted at the behest of India in the wake of the Indo-Lanka Accord, in Nov 1987.

The following is the text of the statement: “We have taken note of the High Commissioner’s report on Sri Lanka and her oral remarks. As its friend and immediate neighbour, India has consistently called upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments on addressing the issues related to protecting the interest of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

India believes that it is in Sri Lanka’s own interest that the expectations of Tamils in Sri Lanka for equality, justice, peace and dignity, within a united Sri Lanka, are fulfilled. This applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government on meaningful devolution, including through the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution.

The Indian delegation has taken note of the engagement by the Government of Sri Lanka with the members of the international community and other relevant organisations on various aspects of the human rights situation and reconciliation issues in Sri Lanka. We would like such engagements and productive and purposeful dialogue to continue among the relevant stakeholders.

The report raises important concerns on promoting, reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. We call upon Sri Lanka to take the necessary steps to address the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil community, including by carrying forward the process of reconciliation and the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all its citizens are fully protected.

We will continue to urge the Sri Lankan Government for the early conduct of elections to the Provincial Councils in keeping with its commitment to devolution of power.”

## [21:41] Kelanitissa receives diesel as govt. strives to minimise load shedding

[http://island.lk/kelanitissa-receives-diesel-as-govt-strives-to-minimise-load-shedding/]

The Kelantissa Power Plant Complex is expected to receive 8,000 MT of fuel today to minimise load shedding in some parts of the country.

On Sunday evening, the power complex was provided with 2000 MT or 2.5 million litres of fuel.

Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa was having talks with some of the Middle East nations to buy oil, a senior government official said.

Energy Minister Lokuge yesterday said that the distribution of diesel and petrol in filling stations had commenced countrywide, and the fuel shortage would be over soon.

The CEB’s monthly fuel requirement is as follows: diesel – 42,000 million litres; furnace oil – 32,000 million litres and naphtha – 28, 000 million litres.

## [21:32] UNFPA and Japan extend digital support for Women Development Officers

[http://island.lk/unfpa-and-japan-extend-digital-support-for-women-development-officers/]

United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) office in Colombo has decided to amplify its battle to minimize sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Sri Lanka by assisting  Women Development Officers to accelerate the digitalization process for a better follow up mechanism, timely referral and response and continuous capacity development amidst the pandemic to improve service quality for survivors of SGBV.

The UNFPA Colombo office said in a release: Pandemics such as COVID-19 affect women and men differently, further exacerbating existing inequalities faced by women and girls. In the midst of the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggests there has been an increase in the reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) due to lockdown and travel restrictions. With health systems stretched in responding to the pandemic, women’s shelters were also reaching capacity with many seeking solace and support. COVID-19 has also severely disrupted access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health services and challenged the authorities’ ability to respond to gender-based violence, at a time when women and girls need these services most. Thus, both state and non-state actors were forced to switch to virtual and remote operations in order to continue to serve and protect women and girls.

Recognizing the gaps, UNFPA, through the PROMISES project funded by the Government of Japan (project budget is approximately 1.47 million USD), amplified its support for Women Development Officers to accelerate the digitization process for a better follow up mechanism, timely referral and response and continuous capacity development amidst the pandemic to improve service quality for survivors of SGBV.

As a part of this support, 14 Laptops were officially handed over to Piyal Nishantha de Silva, State Minister of Women and Child Development, Pre-Schools and Primary Education, School Infrastructure and Social Services, by Hideaki Mizukoshi, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka and  Kunle Adeniyi, Representative UNFPA Sri Lanka, to be distributed among Women Development Officers based at the Women and Child Development Desks at the District and Divisional levels of Sri Lanka.

Since 2018, Japan has been supporting Sri Lanka, as a partner country for the G7 Women, Peace and Security Partnership Initiative (G7 WPS). Ambassador Mizukoshi emphasized the importance of empowering the social and economic environment for women and youth in Sri Lanka, especially those affected by gender-based violence and requested the continued support of the Minister.

Through this project, UNFPA is also working to strengthen shelters that house survivors of violence through a range of holistic support services.

## [21:32] Anyone could join or leave govt. – Johnston

[http://island.lk/anyone-could-join-or-leave-govt-johnston/]

Chief Government Whip and Highways Minister Johnston Fernando says that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government, too, has the same ‘saloon-door’ policy as the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration and anyone could leave or enter if he or she so desires.

Speaking at a ceremony to declare the opening of a new building complex, for the Narammala Pradeshiya Sabha by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Minister said that all those within the government should understand that they were duty bound to protect it. “One cannot be in the government while playing the role of the Opposition. The President had to remove two ministers because they overlooked their responsibility as government ministers and played the role of the Opposition. They must understand that the government still adhered to the saloon-door policy introduced by the incumbent Prime Minister while he was the president. Anyone can leave and in the same way anyone can join us.

“We have won this district because Mahinda Rajapaksa contested from our party. People voted for this government because of him. People respect the political leaders in the government because they respect the party which has Mahinda Rajapaksa. I can remember how he brought Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to the Sugathadasa Stadium, and introduced the latter to the people as his youngest brother and called on them to vote for him. People voted for him and his government because they trusted Mahinda Rajapaksa’s words. They had realised the mistake they had committed in 2015. That was why Gotabaya Rajapaksa could defeat Sajith Premadasa, who had the backing of the political parties in the North, the East and the blessings of the international forces.

“If Mahinda Rajapaksa had continued as the President of the country, without the 2015 regime change, this country would have faced any crisis including the global pandemic. The government that came to power after 2015 destroyed the economy Mahinda Rajapaksa had built. They destroyed the national security and that was the main cause of the Easter Sunday terror attacks that prevented tourists coming to this country. That was when the dwindling of the dollar reserves started. Finally, by the time we took over, the country was competing with Afghanistan not to become the worst economy in the region.
