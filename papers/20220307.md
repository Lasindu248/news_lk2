## [17:31] Power-cut hours to be trimmed: PUCSL Chairman

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Power-cut-hours-to-be-trimmed-PUCSL-Chairman/342-232527]

There is a tendency in reducing the number of power shedding hours by at least two hours with the presence of sufficient diesel and furnace oil and until we get enough rain, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Chairman Janaka Rathnayaka said.

He said within two or three days we will receive adequate fuel for power generation in the country.

We have received a 30,000 MT furnace oil shipment today and the unloading process will start by tomorrow, he said.

We have sufficient coal in hand to operate the coal power plants. After once the adequate fuel arrives, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) would generate 2,100 MW of electricity including 5 GW from hydropower which sufficient for the daily usage.

"With the 900 MW from Norochcholei power plant and another 1,200 MW from operating plants with the use of furnace oil and naptha, we can generate about 2,100 MW of electricity," he said.

Therefore, we would be able to trim the number of power shedding hours in the future. However, the power shedding has to be continued until the country receives adequate rainfall, the Chairman said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Cardinal-urges-UNHRC-to-ensure-impartial-probe-into-Easter-Sunday-attacks/342-232522]

We call upon the UNHRC to support Sri Lanka in gathering more vital  information on the Easter Sunday attacks and ensure an impartial investigation," the Cardinal said.



"The rights of those who were affected by the attacks have been violated as the government has failed to mete out justice to them," he added.

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Autopsy-shows-Shane-Warne-died-of-natural-causes-Thai-police-say/108-232518]

An autopsy showed the death last week of Australian cricket great Shane Warne on an island in Thailand was due to natural causes, the Thai police said on Monday.

Warne's family were told of the result and had accepted the finding. His body would be transferred to Australian consular officials for return to the family, a deputy police spokesman said.

"Today investigators received the autopsy result, in which the medical opinion is that the cause of death is natural," Kissana Phathanacharoen said in a statement.

"Investigators will summarize the autopsy result for prosecutors within the timeframe of the law."

Well-wishers left tributes of flowers, flags, an Australian sports shirt, a can of beans and a packet of cigarettes outside the villa on the northeast coast of Koh Samui where Warne was found unconscious.

Warne, 52, one of the finest spin bowlers of all time, whose talent and personality transcended the sport, died on Friday, spurring tributes, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling him "one of our nation's greatest characters"

Tom Hall, who was staying at the same resort where Warne was found unconscious in his room, said there were "no unusual circumstances" surrounding the flamboyant former cricketer's death.

Hall, chief executive of website the Sporting News, said none of Warne's travelling companions were aware of him visiting a doctor, though he had complained to a friend of "some chest pains and shortness of breath".

Earlier, Thai police said Warne also had asthma and some heart issues, citing information from his family. read more

Australian media said Warne's family funeral would be followed by a memorial service at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) within two or three weeks.

## [14:50] UK calls on SL to engage constructively with recommendations in resolution 46/1

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/UK-calls-on-SL-to-engage-constructively-with-recommendations-in-resolution-461/342-232519]

While raising concerns regarding the continued lack of progress on accountability and regret that there have been setbacks in several emblematic human rights cases, the United Kingdom called on the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 and to co-operate with your Office.

The UK's Global Ambassador for Human Rights, Rita French delivering her statement during the Interactive Dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka, said they welcomed recent releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah as a positive first step. Whilst we acknowledge initial reforms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, these do not go far enough.

"Madam High Commissioner, The United Kingdom welcomes your update. We share your concerns regarding the continued lack of progress on accountability and regret that there have been setbacks in several emblematic human rights cases.

We welcome recent releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah as a positive first step. Whilst we acknowledge initial reforms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, these do not go far enough.

Whilst we acknowledge the NGO Secretariat move to the Foreign Ministry, we have concerns around surveillance and harassment of civil society, and militarisation of civilian governmental functions. The appointment of an individual, named in a key emblematic case, to the post of Provincial Governor, is particularly worrying.

Whilst we acknowledge ongoing work in Government institutions on reparations and missing persons, it is crucial this is accompanied by a comprehensive reconciliation and accountability process.

We note with concern that minority communities are facing increased marginalisation, with allegations of land grabs in the North and East of the country.

We call on the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with the recommendations in resolution 46/1 and to co-operate with your Office," she said.

## [10:23] Brent crude nears $140 per barrel, headed towards all-time high

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Brent-crude-nears-140-per-barrel-headed-towards-all-time-high/108-232502]

Brent oil prices soared to a near 14-year high of $140 on Sunday as traders fretted over the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery reached $139.13 shortly after electronic trading opened around 2300 GMT, heading towards a 2008 record high before retreating slightly over the next hour.

The European benchmark crude hit its record price of $147.50 per barrel in July 2008.

By 0030 GMT, Brent crude had dropped a little more to $128.77 per barrel — 9.02 percent higher than its closing price on Friday.

The price per barrel of Brent oil has increased 33 percent since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

New York’s benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil also soared Sunday to $130.50 per barrel for April delivery. It, too, then dropped slightly over the next hour and a half.

By 0030 GMT, WTI crude was at $125.15 per barrel, an 8.18 percent increase from its closing price on Friday.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington was in “active discussions” with European nations about banning Russian oil imports as further economic penalty against Moscow, although he stopped short of announcing an outright boycott.

Even if oil is technically still exempt from sanctions, Russian oil exporters are struggling to find buyers. Shell is one of the only companies still buying Russian oil, although it said it would donate the profits to Ukrainian causes.

Asked Sunday on CNN about Shell’s announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Shell and other energy giants to cut off Moscow’s biggest revenue source and “stop buying Russian oil.”

“Russian oil and gas smells of Ukrainian blood,” he said.(AFP)

## [10:05] Denara to kick off  first training programmes for young enterprising women

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Denara-to-kick-off-first-training-programmes-for-young-enterprising-women/342-232515]

Denara Training Institute will kick-start their mission and vision while planning to inaugurate their first training programmes for young enterprising women, which coincides with the celebration of International Women's Day.

Denara Training Institute was established in October 2021 with a vision of training young women of all communities living in Sri Lanka in technical and social skills. Why Denara? Because, the name is of Persian origin which refers to "children of heaven and earth.”

Denara is a not for profit organisation, but has to be financially sustainable and hence will charge a nominal fee for the courses they plan to offer. Centrally located in Colombo 5, the establishment of Denara Training Institute is meant to empower women to be independent and take charge of their adult life. It is proposed to have a two part programme to impart employable skills and social skills needed to transition the student to an independent adult life. Speaking to Fathima Aziz, Director, Denara Training Institute, this is what she had to say: "We are looking forward to launching our training programmes for young enterprising women."

The Management proposes to establish English Language Training courses, including Spoken English, Speech and Drama. There will also be courses in Presentation Skills, Conflict Resolution and Negotiation Skills suitable for the current job market. Life skills workshops would include understanding their rights, financial independence, balancing family life and maintaining emotional and overall health. Trained students can subsequently join Denara as a teacher, trainer or counsellor on a paid or voluntary basis as required. It is also proposed to establish a Computer Lab offering IT Skills Training Courses in the near future.

To kick-start their mission and vision, they plan to inaugurate their first programme which coincides with the celebration of International Women's Day. The Denara Training Institute has organized a Cookery Demonstration in association with Singer Sri Lanka (PLC) featuring Ms. Jovanka Jayaweera of Big Bird Delights on Saturday 12th March from 3 to 6 pm at their premises in Mangala Gardens, Colombo 5. She will prepare a variety of popular items using Singer Home Appliances and demonstrate innovative ways to prepare delectable dishes.

International Women's Day is celebrated globally on 8th March celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. International Women's Day has been celebrated for well over a century since 1911. Today, International Women's Day belongs to all groups collectively everywhere and is not confined to any country, group or organisation. The identified theme for 2022 is "Break the Bias."

For further details on available courses, please contact the Denara Training Institute Office located at No 191/50, Mangala Gardens, Off Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 5 or on Tel 011-2505646 or 0778539890.

The country is currently facing a severe gas shortage as three gas tankers are being anchored off the Sri Lankan waters due to the non-issuance of letters of credit by Sri Lankan commercial banks in the face of the dollar crisis.

Informed sources said that since last Friday distribution of Litro gas has come to a complete halt. Our reporters confirmed that people from most of the areas in the country are complaining about the gas shortage in their respective areas.

Due to the shortage, operations of crematoriums, factories and large scale hotels, bakeries have been severely affected. “Some 1000 bakeries have already halted their operations temporarily due to the lack of gas,” a spokesman for the All Ceylon Bakery Owners’ Association said.

Several attempts to contact Litro Gas Company officials have failed.

Meanwhile, informed sources revealed that three gas tankers have been anchored in Sri Lankan waters for the past six days due to the non-issuance of letters of credit by Sri Lankan commercial banks.

Meanwhile, several public protests were held in some areas in the country during the past few days over the gas shortage. (Sunil Jayasiri)

## [09:29] SLPP edges closer to form new govt; MR urgently calls for political calm

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/SLPP-edges-closer-to-form-new-govt-MR-urgently-calls-for-political-calm/342-232490]

In addition to the economic, fuel, power and food crisis which has severely hampered the daily lives of all citizens in the country, Sri Lanka has now been plunged into severe political turmoil after two cabinet ministers were sacked last week and 11 dissident members are now threatening to leave the government.

The sacking of Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa has caused a huge stir within the political ranks with the 11 dissidents which also include former president Maithripala Sirisena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara likely to sit as independent MPs in the next parliamentary session.

President Rajapaksa has shown no indication to take back the sacked duo and has also made it clear that those unable to work with the present government and working against it, will have no place in this government.

He has also not held any discussions with the 11 dissidents, and moves are now underway to see if a complete SLPP government can be formed to restart the stalled work.

However, the man who has now stepped in to calm the situation is Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Following the sacking of Wimal and Udaya last Thursday, Mahinda had called the 11 members and informed them to come to meet him at Temple Trees on Friday in order to leave aside political differences as this was not the time to stir another crisis.

However, despite waiting for all 11 members for several hours on Friday, none of the dissidents showed up and for the first time in Mahinda's political career, he had been stood up.

The Daily Mirror learns that some senior members close to Mahinda had on Friday night asked some of the 11 dissidents as to why they failed to attend the discussions with the Prime Minister to which they had alleged that they had been forced not to attend by Udaya.

This was then conveyed to Mahinda. Mahinda has since then commented that the ongoing economic and fuel crises should be sorted first and relief must be given to the people. He had even mentioned to senior SLPP members that the time was not right for politicians to work on hidden agendas and solutions must be sought to give immediate relief to the citizens.

Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara who is also part of the dissident group, had late on Friday night said he will meet Mahinda on Monday and see if issues can be sorted even if others fail to attend.

However, sacked Minister Udaya Gammanpila had a different story to tell. Udaya told Daily Mirror last evening that Mahinda had not extended any invitation to meet him or Wimal and this was a rumour spread by people with vested interests. He said that following their sacking, Mahinda had called him and Wimal and sympathized with them but had not extended any invitation for any discussions. He said no one else from the SLPP had also contacted them.

Meanwhile senior government sources said that Mahinda had in a public rally held over the weekend hinted that the fuel shortage had been caused artificially and some groups were behind it. He had also said there was improper communication over the fuel crisis and added that in the past Sri Lanka had faced worst scenarios but had been able to get out of it. Political sources within the SLPP said that if Udaya meets Mahinda in any future discussion, he will have to face these questions by the Prime Minister. It is also learnt that while Mahinda is trying to call for political stability, he had also summoned the PUCSL Chairman last week to Temple Trees and sternly told him to stop releasing contradictory statements to the public which was leading to further public anger. It is learnt that the Prime Minister had told the Chairman that this was not the time for the PUCSL to lose its credibility.

In closed-door discussions held by government members last week, it is also learnt that some senior SLPP members had commented saying it was good that the "trouble makers" had been sacked as although Sri Lanka did face a forex issue, the fuel issue could have been sorted out as countries such as the UAE had agreed to supply fuel on a credit line. However the government had failed to act.

Senior ministers had also commented that the time was now right to form a SLPP government, something which has been backed by Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and an option that the President is now considering.

However, despite the efforts of the government or even the Prime Minister to desperately calm the situation, the public are far from convinced that the government including Mahinda will sort the existing crises.

Public anger has spread so much that protests are now breaking out in several areas of the country, with people lining up on the streets every night, asking politicians to stop playing with people's lives. The protests, which have no political backing by any groups, is organized solely by citizens who have expressed disgust at all political parties, especially the government and are urging for normalcy in their daily lives. The protests will continue this week as well and are soon spreading to other districts, increasing the heat on the government. (JAMILA HUSAIN)

## [09:11] Nadungamuwa Raja dies

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Nadungamuwa-Raja-dies/342-232488]

Nadungamuwa Vijaya Raja, popularly known as Nadungamuwa Raja passed away this morning, the caretaker of the elephant Harsha Dharmawijeya said.

He said the elephant died at 5.30 am today following a brief illness.

"The majestic animal did not have previous illness, but it did not take any food during yesterday and breathed for the last time," he said.

The elephant's death was informed to the wildlife department, since the elephant was a property of the government, Dharmawijeya said.

The burial date will be announced after inspection by wildlife officials, the caretaker said.

Nadungamuwa Raja was 65 years old when died, was a celebrated pachyderm with a towering 10.5 feet (3.2 metres) in height and was the tallest tamed tusker in the country which had its own armed guards. Raja walks 90 km (55 miles) to the hill resort of Kandy for the event, called the Esala pageant.

He walks 25 to 30 km a day, travelling mostly at night when the weather is cooler.

Nadungamuwa Raja is an Indian tusker born in 1953 in Mysore, was the main casket bearer of the procession of Esala held in Kandy until recently and was one of the two elephant calves gifted by a Mysuru Maharaja to the veteran native physician monk who was living in Nilammahara Temple Piliyandala in appreciation of curing his relative's long lasted illness, other elephant being Nawam Raja of Gangaramaya that too not among the living.

## [08:05] CB continues to resist  IMF-led debt restructuring to end foreign exchange crisis

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/CB-continues-to-resist-IMF-led-debt-restructuring-to-end-foreign-exchange-crisis/108-232470]

CB Governor says Road Map presented last Oct. has borne fruits and SL has no need of an IMF programme

Says SL doesn’t have a problem in its foreign currency inflows, but a significant increase in outflows

Says no request made to China to restructure Yuan denominated debt

Believes current exchange rate suitable given the ramifications should the rupee was devalued



The Central Bank is still disinclined to recommend to the government to seek  International Monetary Fund (IMF) support for a rescue package and foreign currency debt restructuring even amid the country in a deeper foreign exchange crisis, which has resulted in unending fuel shortages and power cuts.



However, the Central Bank raised policy interest rates by 100 basis points on Friday, delivering the highest rate hike in more than a dozen years and proposed a number of policy adjustments, which more or less mirrored the policy cures IMF prescribed for Sri Lanka in the same week after the conclusion of the Article IV consolations, to help overcome the current crisis. However, their implementation is contingent on the government’s willingness.

Except for the proposal for discouraging non-essential and non-urgent imports, everything else must be implemented to avert further economic calamity, complemented by gradual floating of the currency, according to economic analysts.



Speaking at a post-monetary policy presser held on Friday, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said they remain on course of the Road Map presented in October despite certain delays, and hence the country doesn’t need to seek IMF support or restructure debt under an IMF-backed programme.



According to Cabraal, Sri Lanka doesn’t have a problem in its foreign currency inflows, but a significant increase in outflows, which has resulted in the current predicament in the foreign exchange market.



Merchandise imports to Sri Lanka reached just under US$ 22 billion last year, hitting the highest in three years despite the languishing economy.



However, with or without the IMF, Sri Lanka will have to resolve its foreign exchange crisis soon to avert life and business-crippling fuel shortages and power cuts.



Getting the forex crisis behind them soon is also in the best interest of the government as the crisis has already made cracks in the coalition government with eleven connected parties threatening to pull out.



Meanwhile, in response to a question on the progress of the request made to China for Yuan denominated debt restructuring, Cabraal denied making such a request.



While the Monetary Board had paid attention to make some changes to the exchange rate, Cabraal said the Board deemed the current exchange rate is suitable given the ramifications should the rupee was devalued.

## [08:04] Bonus interest scheme for senior citizen deposits extended by one year

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/business-news/Bonus-interest-scheme-for-senior-citizen-deposits-extended-by-one-year/273-232469]

However, deposits maintained under the scheme will not be auto-renewed

Deposit holders will have to make a declaration to the bank to make available the special interest rate at maturity



The Central Bank has extended the 15 percent special interest scheme for one year term deposits of senior citizens continuing the proposal made in the budget 2017, which was brought with the intention of offering additional income to whose real incomes came under stress.



To this effect, the Central Bank issued operating instructions to all licensed banks fortnight ago requesting them to continue the scheme for all resident Sri Lankan citizens above 60 years of age for one year fixed deposits of up to Rs.1.5 million.



“Annual effective rate payable with effect from the date of opening of the deposit shall be 15 percent”, the Central Bank said in its instructions.



“Licensed banks shall not charge a penalty for premature upliftment of such deposits”, it further said.

However, former Central Bank Deputy Governor and popular economic commentator Dr. W.A. Wijewardena last week on social media said the CB had abolished this special interest rate scheme on senior citizens without citing any sources.



“CB has abolished bonus interest payable to senior citizens at 15 percent up to Rs1.5mn; earlier, IRD abolished tax concessions given to them; now at market rates at -6 percent for fixed deposits,

like farmers, there’re senior citizens agitating for redress; that’s why it’s necessary to raise rates,” he tweeted.

While the deposits maintained under this scheme will not be auto-renewed, the deposit holder will have to make a declaration to the bank to make available the special interest rate at maturity.  The Central Bank raised its key rates by 100 basis points on Friday in response to over a decade high inflation and to ease the demand conditions, which pressure the prices among other things.  Colombo headline inflation for February firmed up at 15.1 percent from a year ago while core prices rose by 10.9 percent in the twelve months to February 2022, hitting a new 13-year high.  Although late, the decision to raise rates by the Central Bank was a step in the right direction from the standpoint of those who live on interest income as inflation has threatened their real incomes.  Record high inflation is a global phenomenon, largely caused by the pent-up demand with the re-opening of economies.  The United States Federal Reserve is battling a 40-year high inflation, and is  poised for its first rate hike in March since the pandemic broke out.

## [08:01] Govt. looking at holistic approach to digitally transform SL: Namal

[https://www.dailymirror.lk/business-news/Govt-looking-at-holistic-approach-to-digitally-transform-SL-Namal/273-232467]

Dedicated efforts are underway to transform Sri Lanka into a technology-based society, as the government is actively looking at a holistic approach to create an ecosystem where citizen services will be supported by digital transformation, State Minister for Digital Technology and Enterprise Namal Rajapaksa said.



In an interview with Telcom Review Asia conducted during his visit to Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Rajapaksa pointed out that the key to achieve the aspired digital transformation is to provide smoother and seamless services to the people of the country.



In that effort, making available the Unique National Digital ID (UID) will be a key milestone for this transformation, he stressed.



“We believe we need to expedite our coverage process. For that, we have launched the Gamata Sanniwedanaya programme that will cover the entire island with 4G. In the meantime, the two main telco companies in Sri Lanka are also putting 5G in trial phase and looking to have a 5G auction in 2022,” said the State Minister highlighting some of the efforts taken to aid Sri Lanka’s digital transformation.

Steps have been also taken to expand the digital economy in the country, especially when in terms of digital banking and adoption of digital currencies.



Rajapaksa said the government is keen on expanding the DTM industry, a move to capitalise on Sri Lanka’s ‘strong and skillful’ labour force.



“Working with the private sector is key to achieve this goal and we believe that by working hand in hand with public-private partnerships, we can digitalise citizen services and expand our digital economy to make it a US$ 10 billion industry in Sri Lanka,” he stressed.



Sri Lanka currently has about 150,000 digitally skilled people in the IT industry and plans are afoot to increase the number to 300,000 next few years.



Rajapaksa said the government is of the view that the roadmap of digitalising the entire government scheme and citizen services with the digital ID card will enable people to be more digitally savvy and get used to using digital services to access education as well.



Furthermore, the government and the relevant authorities have also increased the pace of developing and establishing the required infrastructure and legal framework for regulations.



By the first week of March, Sri Lanka will pass the Data Protection Act. The framework for cybersecurity policy as well as the Cybersecurity Act will be taken up in parliament in the near future.

## [02:18] Chorus growing at UNHRC for greater democracy and justice in Sri Lanka

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Chorus-growing-at-UNHRC-for-greater-democracy-and-justice-in-Sri-Lanka/56-731596]

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet





United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday, introducing the report on Sri Lanka, said the Government should take further steps to address the fundamental problems with the Prevention of Terrorism Act and undertake deeper legal, institutional and security sector reforms that were critically needed to put an end to impunity and prevent any reoccurrence of past violations. Victims and their families continued to be denied truth and justice.

“There was deep concern about the concentration of civilian positions in the hands of military officials, some of them implicated in serious allegations of human rights violations.  The Council should pursue alternative strategies to advance accountability at the international level,” she said.

Sri Lanka, speaking as the country concerned, said the resolution was directly contrary to the Council’s founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.  There were serious anomalies and problems with the report.  It had an intolerably intrusive character and there was a clear element of discrimination within it. This in itself struck at the root of the foundations of the United Nations system.

It was deeply regretted that numerous unsubstantiated allegations had found their way into the report.  The international community should join Sri Lanka on a footing of mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.

In the ensuing debate, speakers said Sri Lanka should ensure a safe democratic space, and strong independent judicial institutions.  The erosion of democratic institutions and the lack of accountability for past human rights violations undermined progress.  The Government had taken the first steps to undertake reforms but there was a long road ahead.

More comprehensive reforms were needed to allow civil society to operate freely and safely and to bring terrorism legislation in line with international norms and standards.  Ensuring accountability and justice for survivors was essential for maintaining peace and ensuring reconciliation.

Some speakers said that reports should be based on reliable, objective and neutral observation.  The development of reports should be done with constructive cooperation with the concerned country.  When dealing with human rights situations, the Council should retain a non-biased, non-selective and non-hypocritical point of view.

Speaking this afternoon on the situation in Eritrea were the European Union, Iceland on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Philippines, France, Djibouti, Luxembourg, Venezuela, China, Cuba, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Russian Federation, Benin, Australia, Sudan, Ireland, Belarus, United States, Belgium, United Kingdom, Canada, Somalia, Syria, Iran and South Sudan.

Also speaking were the following non-governmental organisations: Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Eastern Horn of Africa: Human Rights Defenders Project, Civicus World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Amnesty International, Advocates for Human Rights, and UN Watch.

Speaking on Sri Lanka were the European Union, Netherlands on behalf of the Benelux countries, Norway on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, United Kingdom on behalf of the Sri Lanka Core Group, Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Germany, Egypt, Montenegro, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Canada, Philippines, Nepal, Kenya, India and France.

Speakers said Sri Lanka should ensure a safe democratic space and strong independent judicial institutions.  The erosion of democratic institutions and the lack of accountability for past human rights violations was undermining progress. The building of a prosperous State for all Sri Lankans was required, including all minorities.

The Government had taken the first steps to undertake reforms, but there was a long road ahead.  There was also concern for political prisoners still in custody, and concern that the proposed changes were not sufficient to address human rights concerns.  There should be freedom of speech for journalists and those in minority communities, as well as non-governmental organisations.

The Government should ensure the independence and effectiveness of human rights institutions, and encourage proper investigation of reports of deaths in police custody.  There should be full implementation of Council resolution 46/1.

More comprehensive reforms were needed to allow civil society to operate freely and safely, and to bring terrorism legislation in line with international norms and standards.  The rights of religious minorities should be protected.  More inclusive governance was needed in Sri Lanka: a safe and open space should be maintained, even for dissent.  Ensuring accountability and justice for survivors was essential for maintaining peace and ensuring reconciliation.

A more comprehensive and deeper reform agenda was required to ensure that future violations could not occur.  The Government should fully consider the numerous and consecutive recommendations made by various United Nations mechanisms and organisations.  The lack of domestic progress in accountability and the reconciliation process required further commitment by the Government.  The human rights situation could degrade further if steps were not taken to address the issues of the past.

Some speakers said that reports should be based on reliable, objective and neutral observation.  The development of reports should be done with constructive cooperation with the concerned country.  When dealing with human rights situations, the Council should retain a non-biased, non-selective and non-hypocritical point of view.

The community of nations should support in good faith any steps taken towards reconciliation in the country, and encourage genuine dialogue in an impartial manner, standing against selectivity, politicisation and double standards.  The Human Rights Council should support Sri Lanka in order to achieve its priorities for its domestic development in the context of its own needs.

## [02:17] Core Group notes Sri Lanka’s progress in addressing key reforms limited

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Core-Group-notes-Sri-Lanka-s-progress-in-addressing-key-reforms-limited/56-731595]

The Core Group on Sri Lanka while acknowledging first steps by Sri Lanka to address key reforms, noted that progress since Council resolution 46/1 is limited.

Issuing a statement on Friday at the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council, the Sri Lanka Core Group comprising Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi, Montenegro, the United Kingdom and the United States said, in particular, slow progress by the Office of Missing Persons in fully investigating cases since the release of the preliminary list of missing persons is troubling.

“Our concerns over surveillance and intimidation of civil society persist and detentions, threats and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders continue. It is crucial that civic space remains open.”

The Core Group welcomed the releases on bail of Ahnaf Jazeem and Hejaaz Hizbullah, but said the proposed changes to the PTA are very limited and our longstanding concerns remain.

“The Core Group on Sri Lanka today while recognising the challenges the island nation is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to express concern about current human rights developments in Sri Lanka and stressed the importance of a comprehensive reconciliation and accountability process.”

The Core Group noted that new ‘One Country One Law’ taskforce risks undermining Sri Lanka’s pluralist society and urged Sri Lanka to ensure that this taskforce’s work is inclusive and non-discriminatory.

“We call for full cooperation with the High Commissioner and remain ready to support the Government on the implementation of resolution 46/1,” the Core Group said.

## [02:14] Sri Lanka exposes UNHRC’s double standards and discrimination

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Sri-Lanka-exposes-UNHRC-s-double-standards-and-discrimination/56-731594]

Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris delivers Sri Lanka’s statement at interactive dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka at the 49th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday















Sri Lanka on Friday alleged double standards and discrimination on the part of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) whilst it expressed concerns over numerous instances of unsubstantiated allegations on the part of the latter.

This view was expressed by Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris in his statement during the interactive dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka at the 49th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Following is the full statement by Sri Lanka.

The Resolution 46/1 on Sri Lanka was adopted by a divided vote in this Council. Sri Lanka and other Member States opposed this resolution in fundamental disagreement with its deeply flawed procedure and unacceptable content, in particular its OP para 6 regarding a so-called evidence-gathering mechanism. The Resolution was directly contrary to the Council’s founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. It went well beyond the mandate that Member States conferred on it by UNGA Resolution 60/251. I have stated Sri Lanka’s views on this matter to this Council on 1 March. We also submitted in a timely manner our comments on the High Commissioner’s report. We note with regret that the Secretariat failed to publish this simultaneously with the High Commissioner’s written update.

Despite our rejection of the resolution, we will continue our voluntary international undertakings on human rights and engage with the United Nations, including with this Council. As stated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka to our Parliament on 18 January 2022, “We are a nation that respects international laws and conventions”. We have regularly shared our progress and challenges in a candid and open exchange with this Council and other relevant organs of the United Nations system.

We are convinced that there are serious anomalies and weaknesses in the report presented to this Council by the High Commissioner. The fundamental deficiency is its intolerably intrusive character, impinging as it does on core functions and responsibilities of organs of the Sri Lankan State, overwhelmingly mandated by the people of our country at three successive elections.

There is, as well, a clearly discernible element of discrimination, in that the Council would certainly not take it upon itself to embark on a similar inquisitorial procedure in respect of other Member States. This, in itself, strikes at the very root of the foundations of the United Nations system. The issue of uniformity and consistency of standards applied by the High Commissioner to Member States, irrespective of their size and influence, and in steadfast conformity with the essential principle relating to the sovereign equality of all members of the United Nations fraternity, is cynically transgressed in several portions of this report.

To our minds, this is particularly disturbing because the strength and prestige of the United Nations, and especially the Human Rights Council, derive from the widespread regard of the international community, as a whole, for the moral and ethical basis underpinning the attitudes of the Council. We fervently believe that it is vitally important to retain this confidence undiminished, especially having regard to the fate of the Human Rights Commission, the predecessor of this Council. It is a matter for deep regret that numerous instances of unsubstantiated allegations and superficial conclusions insensitive to the complexity of ground situations have found their way into the report. We have commented on these in extensive detail in our written response.

We are dismayed by the High Commissioner’s unwarranted onslaught on seminal institutions of our country which function under the aegis of Sri Lanka’s Constitution and legal system, emanating from a rich and varied cultural heritage, and are subject to stringent review processes which form an integral part of our tried and tested laws.

There is also the question of use of stringently limited resources in such a manner as to achieve optimal benefit for all of humanity at a time of unprecedented crisis. The colossal expenditure of millions of dollars in a partisan and specifically targeted pursuit of Sri Lanka is hardly consonant with this obvious imperative. It seems to us a great pity that the report shows scant regard for these considerations which appear to a wide swath of nations to be crucially important at this time.

The Government of Sri Lanka is firmly resolved to maintain the security and stability that we have restored for our people and ensure sustainable progress in an equitable manner. My country reaches out to the international community with the sincere exhortation to join us as partners on a footing of equality and mutual respect to face the challenges ahead.

New United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie J. Chung called on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at Temple Trees on Friday for the first time since assuming duties.

The new US Ambassador emphasised that she was seeking to further strengthen the existing political, social and economic ties with Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister’s Office said.

Ambassador Chung said that the United States will help keep the Sri Lankan economy strong in the face of the COVID -19 pandemic and also expressed confidence that the US would assist in the development of Sri Lanka’s energy and tourism sectors.

The Premier assured that the Government of Sri Lanka will work to maintain the existing relations between the United States and Sri Lanka. He offered congratulations and best wishes to Chung for success in her new post.
