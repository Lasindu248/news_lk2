Daily COVID-19 detections dropped to 583 yesterday, the lowest it has been since January.

According to the Epidemiology Unit, 461 persons tested positive for COVID-19 on 10 January and daily detections have since remained above 600.

All patients detected yesterday were from the New Year cluster, the Department of Government Information states.

A gradual decline in daily detections has been observed this week, with 711 persons testing positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. This includes 710 persons from the New Year cluster and one Sri Lankan returnee from overseas.

However, daily testing has remained below 10,000 since 26 February. The Health Promotion Bureau states that only 4,689 PCR tests and 2,475 rapid antigen tests were conducted on Thursday.

A total of 648,993 COVID-19 cases have been detected in the country. This includes 543,225 persons from the New Year cluster, 82,785 persons from the Peliyagoda cluster, 9,154 persons from the Prisons cluster and 3,059 persons from the Divulapitiya cluster.

The country’s imported cases include 7,235 Sri Lankan returnees from overseas and 328 foreigners.

The Epidemiology Unit states that 135,081 persons from Colombo, 112,612 persons from Gampaha, 57,459 persons from Kalutara, 43,348 persons from Galle and 30,842 persons from Kurunegala have tested positive for COVID-19.

During the third wave of the pandemic, 102,784 patients from Colombo, 94,078 patients from Gampaha and 50,401 patients from Kalutara were detected. At present, 23,006 persons are under medical or home-based care and 816 persons suspected of having COVID-19 are under observation.

The country’s COVID-19 recoveries rose to 609,680 with 195 persons discharged from treatment centres yesterday.

Meanwhile, health experts yesterday emphasised the importance of adhering to safety guidelines and getting vaccinated given the reopening of schools next week.

“When school activities resume, roads get busy and travel increases. With this, there is a rise in COVID-19 as well as other communicable diseases spreading at the moment, like diarrhoea and diseases of the respiratory tract,” Colombo Medical Faculty Professor and Paediatrician Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe said.

He explained that there is an adverse impact on the child when they are unable to go to school for an extended period of time and socialise, as seen during the pandemic. While adding that a survey has not been done on childhood obesity since the pandemic, Prof. Wickramasinghe said that he has noticed a doubling of childhood obesity numbers, which is a serious situation.

“Depending on how long they have been obese for and the transformation that happened to their body during this time, they may develop other diseases in the long term,” Prof. Wickramasinghe said. These conditions include heart disease, diabetes and cirrhosis. “This is the unseen side of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he added.

## [00:39] 26,028 persons vaccinated against COVID-19

[https://www.ft.lk/news/26-028-persons-vaccinated-against-COVID-19/56-731522]

Health officials state that booster dose coverage among the target population has exceeded 50%, adding that COVID-19 vaccinations were administered to 26,028 persons on Thursday.

According to Health Promotion Bureau Director Dr. Ranjith Batuwanthudawa, 51% of the target population has received the booster dose. He added that exceeding 50% coverage was significant.

“A drop in COVID-19 detections can be seen at present and we believe that the high percentage of booster coverage has contributed to this,” Dr. Batuwanthudawa went on to say.

According to him, the administration of the first vaccine dose to children over 12 years and the second vaccine dose to children over 16 years is currently taking place.

Colombo University Medical Faculty Senior Professor and Paediatrician Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe explained that the technical committee is currently collecting relevant data on vaccination of the under-12 age group. Global data must be analysed before a decision is made, he said.

“On the other hand, we must also see if there is a significant adverse effect on the child if they are not vaccinated and because there is no significant impact, we have been gradually lowering the age limit,” Dr. Wickramasinghe said, explaining that it was important to balance both these aspects to vaccination, especially when administering a newly-developed vaccine to children.

According to the Family Health Bureau, there has been a good response for vaccination of school children within the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area. Officer in Charge of the Bureau’s School Health Unit Narahenpita Dr. Jayalath said that vaccination is yet to be carried out in just 20 schools within the CMC area but that this too, will be completed in the next 14 days.

He explained that 50% of the total children have been vaccinated. “However, I believe this number is much higher as our unit is not the only one carrying out vaccination. Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children administers vaccines daily from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and the number of school children vaccinated there is not included in our numbers,” Dr. Jayalath said.

As of 2 March, 79.3% of the population aged 16 to 19 years had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Epidemiology Unit adds that 95.8% of the population over 12 years has received the first vaccine dose and 80.4% has received the second dose as well.

Second dose coverage among the population over 20 years was 95.5% as of Wednesday and third dose coverage was 49.46%.

Of the country’s total population, 77.16% has received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 64.73% has received the second dose and 32.97% has received the third dose.

A total of 16,914,562 persons have received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 14,190,304 persons have received the second dose as well.

The third dose has been administered to 7,248,832 persons. This includes 20,034 persons vaccinated on Thursday. The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is being administered as the booster dose.

On Thursday, 2,986 persons received the first dose of Pfizer and 2,056 persons received the second dose of the vaccine. A total of 2,447,874 persons have received the first dose of Pfizer and 730,063 persons have received the second dose.

The first dose of Sinopharm was administered to 366 persons on Thursday, raising the number of persons to have received the first dose of Sinopharm in total to 12,023,146. The second dose of the vaccine has been administered to 11,098,475 persons. This includes 586 persons vaccinated on Thursday.

The first dose of AstraZeneca has been administered to 1,479,631 persons and the second dose has been administered to 1,418,593 persons.

A total of 804,801 persons have received the first dose of Moderna and 787,361 persons have received the second dose of the vaccine.

The Epidemiology Unit states that 159,110 persons have received the first dose of Sputnik V and 155,812 persons have received the second dose as well.

## [00:39] Full trial of Easter Sunday terror attack suspects from 12 May

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Full-trial-of-Easter-Sunday-terror-attack-suspects-from-12-May/56-731521]

## [00:38] Lankan family sues Japan over immigration detention death

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Lankan-family-sues-Japan-over-immigration-detention-death/56-731520]

(AFP) TOKYO: The family of a Sri Lankan woman who died in Japanese immigration detention sued the government on yesterday, in a high-profile case that has reignited calls to reform conditions in the system.

Wishma Sandamali, 33 died a year ago while detained for overstaying her visa after seeking police protection, reportedly to escape an abusive relationship.

She had allegedly complained of stomach pain and other symptoms for several weeks and a government probe into her death concluded she received inadequate treatment as her health deteriorated. Her death at a facility in the central city of Nagoya prompted the justice minister last year to apologise and pledge to improve medical provision to detainees.

Sandamali’s family sued the national government yesterday, their lawyer’s office told AFP without giving details. Local media reported the family was seeking 156 million yen ($ 1.3 million) in damages.

Carrying a framed photograph of Sandamali, her younger sister told reporters she was bracing for a long wait for further information. “I’m very sad that we had to take legal action to find out what happened to my elder sister,” she said in the Sinhala language. “Litigation means a process that will take a few more years. That means I have to wait a few more years to find out the reason for my elder sister’s death”. “I am truly sad that it had to come to this.”

Rights campaigners have long criticised conditions at Japanese detention centres, including how guards respond to medical emergencies. Justice Minister Yoshihisa Furukawa on Friday offered condolences to her family and vowed to prevent a recurrence. Sandamali’s death “never should have happened in a facility entrusted with the lives of detainees”, he told reporters.

Last summer, former justice minister Yoko Kamikawa said the probe had not conclusively determined the cause of death, but found the detention centre “lacked a system to assess the health of detainees and provide medical services”.

Japan’s ruling lawmakers also last year dropped a controversial push to make it easier to deport unsuccessful asylum seekers following opposition pressure.

## [00:22] Japan to support improving facilities of support centre in Kandy

[https://www.ft.lk/news/Japan-to-support-improving-facilities-of-support-centre-in-Kandy/56-731512]

The Government of Japan has provided a total sum of $ 63,935 (approx. Rs. 12.4 million) to Child Action Lanka for ‘The project for improving facilities of support centre for vulnerable children, youth and women in Kandy district’. The grant contract was signed on 3 March between Ambassador of Japan Mizukoshi Hideaki, and Child Action Lanka Founding Director Deborah Edirisinghe.

This project will focus on renovating a support centre and expanding the premises to accommodate more vulnerable people to provide a safe space, educational environment and opportunities of getting vocational skills.  Child Action Lanka (CAL) is an organisation that was founded in 2006 to serve street-connected and poverty-marginalised children. Today, it operates across the island reaching the poorest of the poor to provide equal opportunity to education, healthcare, nutrition and child protection. In addition, CAL expands its reach to working with vulnerable women through its own safe home, shelter and women’s community development programs. The CAL support centre in Kandy reached its maximum capacity and often had to rotate programs to ensure everyone had a fair chance to access its services. The new facility will be able to help more children receive free educational assistance, provide youth with opportunities to be trained for employment and provide women with a space to learn and create income generating products that can help uplift their standards of living.

“This year, we are in the midst of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two nations. The Government of Japan will continue to support the effort for child protection and empowerment of women to achieve and sustain peace in Sri Lanka,” stated Ambassador Hideaki. Commenting on the provision of this grant Edirisinghe stated, “This new facility will stand as an icon of hope for those who need it the most. In its provision for extra classrooms, an IT centre and state-of-the-art auditorium will enable CAL to provide empowerment to children, youth and women who would otherwise not be able to access assistance. The facility will serve as a stepping stone to help to see families empowered and children being transformed through education. We together with the Child Action Lanka team, its children and the community express our sincere heartfelt gratitude for the provision of this grant knowing it will help transform the lives of many young people, children and women in the years to come.”

## [00:19] EU Ambassadors visit  rural development projects in Central Province

EU and Member State Ambassadors at the opening of the Business Service Centre in Nuwara Eliya





The European Union (EU) and EU Member States Ambassadors resident in Sri Lanka, travelled this week to Nuwara Eliya district in the Central Province for a two-day visit to EU-funded rural development projects.

During their visit, the EU Ambassadors visited and handed over a number of infrastructure facilities in the region, such as a new Business Service Centre in Nuwara Eliya, a renovated tea estate water supply system in Ragala, and a potato seed production unit in Kandapola. All these activities have been developed and funded under the EU program ‘Support to integrated rural development in the most vulnerable districts of Uva and Central Provinces’.

This program, launched in 2017, was the first major European initiative in the region with approximately Rs. 6 billion (EUR 30 million) of grant assistance provided to four districts of Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla and Monaragala located in the Uva and Central Provinces.

Over the past five years, the EU has partnered with both the Government of Sri Lanka, private sector and civil society organisations to improve the situation of small businesses, provide infrastructure for better health, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation practices, and to strengthen socio-economic service delivery by local authorities, community organisations and the private sector in both provinces.

The EU Ambassadors were informed that over 600 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been supported, out of which over 200 are women-owned. The SME development promotion initiatives have made an impressive impact on income and employment generation, market development, technology development and business skills development, ensuring private sector growth and sustainability. The program has helped to reduce the barriers women entrepreneurs encounter in accessing finance and other services. Through these efforts over 1,500 jobs have been created, increasing women’s labour force participation.

During the visit, the group was informed that the EU has assisted in providing safe drinking water to over 35,000 people and renovated water systems and latrines in over 70 schools and 30 villages. This has allowed over 4,000 children access to safe drinking water and improved sanitary facilities in their schools.

EU Ambassador Denis Chaibi said, “Promoting local economic development and social inclusion has been at the heart of our support for years. Since 2014, the EU and its Member States have provided more than EUR 210 million (approximately 48 billion rupees) to improve the quality of life of Sri Lankans, including in the Uva and Central Provinces, which are among the poorest areas in the country. This visit was undertaken in a spirit of Team Europe; my fellow European Ambassadors and I are happy to our long-term assistance bringing positive change to people’s lives.”

As part of the two-day visit, the EU Ambassadors also participated in the opening of the “Thé Kahata” photography exhibition, organised by the Centre for Policy Alternatives, initially supported under the EU-funded project ‘Strengthening the Reconciliation Process in Sri Lanka’ and implemented by GIZ. The exhibition, featuring over 100 photographs of daily life of upcountry Tamil communities, used art as a vehicle to promote dialogue and explore themes such as identity and inequality.
